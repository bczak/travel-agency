The river was important during this period as it formed a physical boundary between the Moabites and the Amorites. The canyon opens out to the Dead Sea at an altitude of 410m below sea level making it the lowest nature reserve on Earth.Following this we will visit Mount Nebo - a Holy site in Jordan said to have been the place where Moses saw the Promised Land before he died as mentioned in the Old Testament.
