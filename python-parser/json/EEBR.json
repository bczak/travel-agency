On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Budapest! Hungary's stylish capital is known as the 'City of Spas' for its abundance of natural thermal springs. With a host of historical sights, buzzing nightlife and unique attractions, Budapest is a favourite for many travellers visiting the region.Straddling the Danube River, the city is comprised of two very different historic cities, Buda on the west bank and Pest on the east bank. Highlights here include Castle Hill, Matthias Church, Fisherman's Bastion, the Liberation Monument, the fabulous St Stephen's Basilica and the much photographed Parliament Building. An evening river cruise is an excellent way to see the parliament lit up at night.You are free to arrive at your leisure and enjoy all Budapest has to offer. We highly recommend booking pre tour accommodation or arriving early in the day so that you can tick off the highlights. There will be a pre departure meeting held tonight at 6pm in your hotel. Please check reception for details.This morning we take a short train ride to Eger, located on the hills of the Bukk Mountains, and a real gem within Hungary. With a number of historic sights such as the castle, cathedral, and the northernmost minaret in Europe, Eger is a wonderfully quaint town and the perfect contrast from the bustling capital of Budapest. Best known for its production of the famous \"Bulls Blood\" red wine, Eger is a large producer of Hungarian wine and you will have ample opportunity to sample some of Hungary's finest. Spend an afternoon exploring the \"Valley of the Beautiful Women\", a collection of wine cellars where you can sample the unique blends of local wines and speak with the producers.After a 91 year long Turkish rule in the 15th century, Eger has an abundance of Ottoman influence and beautiful architecture that can be seen as you explore on foot.The day is spent exploring the fascinating Maramures region in North-western Romania, home to many villages where century-old traditions are still part of daily life. We will observe a pottery demonstration, visit a traditional watermill and make a stop at the very peculiar 'Merry Cemetery' of Sap\u00e2nta, so called because the gravestones are painted in bright colours, hand-carved out of oak and adorned with an image of the deceased and a humorous epitaph in the local vernacular.This is a full day of exploring the Maramures and we will arrive to the guesthouse around 7pm to enjoy a traditional dinner.This morning we will visit the village of Barsana, where there is a thriving local tradition of woodcarving, with picturesque wooden houses fronted by giant, ornately-carved gates. There is also a monastery that offers great views over the Izei valley, where people still farm using traditional techniques. We also tour some of the beautiful UNESCO listed wooden churches of the region that are well-known for their characteristic high roofs and tall, pointed steeples.In the afternoon we head to Sighisoara. Located in the historic region of Transylvania, it was once a Saxon settlement established in the 12th century. Recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, the citadel has a very well preserved old town with a clock tower rising 64 meters above the city. Also worth visiting is the Orthodox Cathedral and Cornesti Church.Today you are free to explore and enjoy Sighisoara! You could take a guided tour of the Old Town, check out the unique Torture Museum or visit Dracula's House.Surrounded on three sides by the Carpathian Mountains, Bra&#x219;ov was a perfect place for a medieval settlement and much of the Old City, founded by the Teutonic Knights in 1211, has been restored.You can visit R&#xe2;&#x219;nov Castle,  the Bra&#x219;ov Citadel or wander up Rope Street, the narrowest street in Europe. Bra&#x219;ov also provides a great base for exploring the surrounding countryside of the Transylvania region, where the air is fresh and the people friendly.On our way to Bra&#x219;ov we make stops at two historic and important churches, Viscri and Prejmer fortified churches.Today we visit the nearby Bran Castle which is known as 'Dracula's Castle' and is (supposedly) said to have been the home of Vlad the Impaler.The rest of the afternoon is free for you to enjoy Bra&#x219;ov.This morning we explore the beautiful Pele's\u00a0Castle, an impressive structure which is sure to take your breath away!We then head to Bucharest where you will have free time to explore the area and discover the contrasts of Romania's cultural capital. The architecture here is an eclectic mix of historical, communist period and modern styles and it even has its own Arc de Triomphe. Bucharest also boasts the world's second largest building, the Palace of Parliament, built under the communist regime.If you'd like to learn more about the traditional way of life of Romanian peasant farmers you can visit the Village Museum, an open air museum with around 300 traditional buildings filled with furniture, pottery and clothing collected from different regions of the country.Your adventure of a lifetime comes to an end today.  If you have a late flight or have lengthened your stay by adding post tour accommodation you will have more time to explore the sights.Your adventure of a lifetime comes to an end today.
