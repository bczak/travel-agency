The three great pyramids that are part of The Giza plateau date back from a period of construction between 3,800 and 2,800 BC and are located on the West bank of the River Nile because of the symbolism associating with the realm of the dead when the sun sets there in the evenings.After an exciting day of exploring these great ancient monuments you will head to the train station to board your overnight sleeper train to Aswan.

Both temples were discovered in 1813, after centuries of being buried under desert sands, but were then relocated in 1960 with the help of the Egyptian government and UNESCO to avoid the rising water of the Nile. A site not to be missed!Alternatively you can spend the morning relaxing before boarding your traditional felucca boat to embark on an unforgettable sailing adventure down the River Nile.
