On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Sri Lanka! You are free to arrive today at your leisure.Negombo is situated by the shores of a lagoon by the same name. Once a Portuguese and Dutch trading port, popular attractions here include the Old Dutch fort gate built in 1672, the Dutch Canal, and the old churches and fishing villages which surround the area. In fact, due to the many ornate Roman Catholic churches scattered throughout, Negombo is sometimes known as &#34;The Little Rome&#34;. It also has a huge and rather inviting white sandy beach!Also worth exploring is the Kochchikade area, that comes to life at dusk with many handicrafts for sale, boutiques, shops, gem shops and restaurants for you to explore.There will be a pre departure meeting tonight at 6pm where you will meet your tour leader and fellow travellers.This morning we enjoy a Negombo city tour before heading towards Anuradhapura. Enroute, we will stop at the fish market and fishing village before visiting a coconut plantation.Anuradhapura, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site was founded in the 4th century BC and was the capital of the Anuradhapura Kingdom until the beginning of the 11th century AD.

Built between the 11th and 12th centuries AD, Polonnaruwa is a listed World Heritage site. Here you can see the ruins of the Royal Palace, the Gal Viharaya, and four statues of the Buddha in 'Upright', 'Sedentary' and 'Recumbent' postures carved out of rock. Polonnaruwa is laid out over a large distance, therefore the best way to explore the area is by bicycle which we will do a guided tour. If you prefer not to bike, it is possible to take the guided tour in the private vehicle.This morning we head to Sigiriya, (Lions Rock), an impressive site from a distance rising 200 metres from the jungle. With hundreds of steps to climb to reach the top of the 5th century AD rock fortress, the view from the top over the surrounding landscape is incredible.
