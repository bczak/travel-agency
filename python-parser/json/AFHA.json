Packed with iconic sights, amazing safaris and jaw-dropping landscapes, it is the perfect tour for anyone wanting to see the best of the continent. We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Nairobi and the start of your adventure! Kenya\u2019s capital city is a hub for business and culture with an inner population of around 3.5 million.You are free to arrive today at your leisure. If you wish to go exploring, we recommend seeking local advice from the hotel about where is safe to walk. Petty theft is unfortunately common in Nairobi and you should remain vigilant at all times.There will be a pre departure meeting tonight to meet your tour leader and fellow travellers. Please look out for information on reception.After breakfast this morning we transfer to Nairobi Airport to take our flight to Kigali, Rwanda\u2019s capital. Kigali is the largest city of Rwanda, and is a large cultural and commercial hub.Kigali has had a turbulent past and was the scene of the Rwandan Genocide which you will learn more about tomorrow. In recent years, it has transformed and is now one of the most attractive cities in Africa with pretty boulevards, tasty restaurants and a lively atmosphere. On arrival the rest of your afternoon / evening is free to relax.After breakfast you will be collected from your hotel and taken on a private guided tour to visit the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre where you will learn about the recent history of the Rwandan Genocide and the mass execution of the Tutsi population.We will make a brief stop for lunch before leaving the capital. We will pass through lush countryside, and rolling plantations, seeing many locals go about their daily lives before crossing the border into Uganda, where we will then be transferred to Lake Bunyonyi, arriving late afternoon.Lake Bunyonyi is our base for the next few days and will be the start point for our excursion to see endangered mountain gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. There are believed to be less than 800 mountain gorillas remaining in the world, and about half of that population live in this forest. To watch them in their natural habitat is a heart-stirring experience.Please note: A yellow fever vaccination is required if you are travelling to/from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission in Africa; this includes transiting through a yellow fever risk country. The Majority of our tours in Africa require a yellow fever certificate therefore we highly recommend that you obtain this prior to travel. Please make sure that on arrival you have a valid yellow fever certificate ready for inspection by local customs or health authorities, otherwise you could be refused entry or quarantined.Today can be quite a long day so make sure you pack enough water in your day bag to keep hydrated on your trek. To reach the trekking starting point, we will be picked up early in the morning to head for the national park. Expect to trek for up to eight hours today as specialist guides go ahead of you, early in the morning and track the gorilla spoor and look for signs of the gorillas last movements. The distance you trek is unpredictable and varies depending on how active the gorillas are. Some will not move far from where the trackers left them the day before while others will travel long distances in the search for food.Bwindi Impenetrable Forest is a series of rolling hills with heavy foliage and trekking to the gorillas can often involve steep uphill or downhill climbs, sometimes on uneven and wet terrain. Hiking boots are important and you can rent walking sticks at an extra cost to stabilise your feet. The altitude in the forest is varied, with the highest point being 2607m above sea level and 60% of it being over 2000m. With this in mind, you might find hiking through the terrain slightly more difficult than at sea level. Your guides will keep you give you a detailed safety briefing before you depart on the hike and will reiterate key points shortly before getting close to the gorillas.Your time with the gorillas is restricted to one hour. This is to safeguard the gorilla families and prevent excessive human contact. You can admire the animals and take photos so make sure your batteries are charged and your memory cards empty. Once your hour is up, you will begin the climb out of the forest. Your guides will take you to the nearest road where a 4WD should be waiting to take you back to camp.You can read more about the gorilla trek here.Today you will have a free morning to relax and recuperate after your trek.

You may spot the odd giraffe or two chewing through thorny acacia trees in the woodland areas. Etosha National Park is a bird watcher's paradise with some 340 species inhabiting the park at different times of the year. For a short period after seasonal rains Etosha's vast salt pan is covered by a layer of water which attracts massive flocks of pelicans, flamingoes and other wading birds. While the pan is dry it is notable for the way it dramatically changes colour during the early morning and late afternoon sun.This morning we leave the Etosha National Park area and make our way towards Otjiwarongo.

This is the only city in Namibia and is home to a population of over 250,000 inhabitants.Like in Swakopmund there is a noticeable German influence here. German is still widely spoken and it is common to find traditional breads, sausage, and other delicacies, they even hold annual beer festivals.No tourists visit to Windhoek is complete without paying a visit to Joe\u2019s Beer house, a bar and restaurant providing a mix of warm Namibian and German hospitality. This place is full of old relics from \u2018Joe\u2019s\u2019 travels and creates a great atmosphere for socialising and reminiscing about your journey so far. Here you can also opt to sample some delicious game meats or try out one of the many craft beers on offer.Departing the capital we drive towards the Tropic of Capricorn where we make a stop so that you can get that obligatory picture with the sign. From here we continue on to Solitaire, a small settlement in the Khomas Region of Central Namibia, close to the Namib-Naukluft National Park. This small desert community has only a gas station, post office, bakery and general store.

This is South Africa\u2019s longest river and runs along the border of Namibia and South Africa.  En-route to Orange River we stop at Fish River Canyon which is one of the world's largest canyons and it is quite breathtaking in its immensity; it is rivalled only by the Grand Canyon in North America for sheer grandeur. We will park at the viewpoint overlooking the canyon and can take a short walk along the canyon rim, stopping along the way for photos.The Fish River running through the bottom of the canyon is one of Namibia's few permanent rivers and while the flow is seasonal, beautiful turquoise pools can be seen in the distance during the dry season. As you walk and enjoy the colours of the strata and rugged scenery, you may be lucky enough to spot hardy mountain animals in the distance, as well as numerous bird species. Weather depending we will have lunch at the viewpoint.As we head towards Cape Town we make a stop in the Cederberg wilderness area with its rugged landscape criss-crossed by streams, waterfalls, cool pools and amazing natural rock formations. Here you will get to sample some of the local wines on our included wine tasting tour.Situated on the south western tip of Africa and set between the Atlantic Ocean and the iconic Table Mountain, Cape Town is recognised as one of the most beautiful cities on Earth.There are dozens of amazing sightseeing opportunities to enjoy in Cape Town and in the surrounding area. You can tackle a trek up Table Mountain or take the cable car to the top for spectacular views of the city. If you have a good head for heights you can enjoy the scenery looking over Camps Bay then rather than taking the cable car, abseil 112 metres down again, but this option is not one for the faint hearted!

Be sure to sample some of South Africa's famous wines with dinner and sit back with a hot cup of rooibos herbal tea afterwards.From Cape Town, you can visit Robben Island where former South African President and Nobel Laureate Nelson Mandela was incarcerated among other political prisoners. Once a blight on the nation's history, the island is now seen as a national symbol of triumph over adversity and has been recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

Excursions to the island are weather dependant.Please note:We highly recommend booking post tour accommodation in Cape Town to enjoy all the activities on offer.Your adventure of a lifetime comes to an end today.
