On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Moscow! You are free to arrive today at your leisure and start enjoying all that Moscow has to offer.Golden onion domes and towering skyscrapers, cosy cafes and hushed churches, Russia's capital city is beautiful, atmospheric and overflowing with history. There is plenty to see and do here, including numerous cathedrals, museums, art galleries, palaces, the State History Museum and the iconic St Basil's Cathedral, towers and monuments. We highly recommend arriving in Moscow a day or so earlier to make the most of this fascinating city.Moscow's Red Square (Krasnaya Ploshad) is the main centre of the city and was a market place during the fifteenth century. The red part of its name does not refer to Communism or to the colour of the stone (which is actually grey) but derives from the old Russian word krasniy meaning beautiful. During the Soviet regime the square was known for its May Day parades and is the site of Lenin's Mausoleum.It is said that soon after January 21, 1924, the day that Vladimir Lenin died, the Soviet government received more than 10,000 telegrams from all over Russia, which asked the government to preserve his body somehow for future generations. Lenin's tomb, and final resting place, was then promptly set about being designed and a wooden tomb was constructed within 6 days of his death. A larger mausoleum was constructed later that year and stands today in the centre of the city in the prominent Red Square.There will be a pre departure meeting held in your hotel at 6pm tonight. Please check reception for details.Today you will have a guided tour of the Kremlin. The famous building is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site and a main focus of Russia's political and historical heritage since the 13th century, housing both royalty and religious figures.

It has been ruled by Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles and Russians, with the more distinctive Estonian identity coming to light in the late 19th century. During World War II, Estonia was ultimately incorporated into the Soviet Union after years of contest, which lead to years of communist rule.
