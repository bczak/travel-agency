  "description": "A We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Nairobi and the start of your adventure! Kenya\u2019s capital city is a hub for business and culture with an inner population of around 3.5 million.You are free to arrive today at your leisure. If you wish to go exploring, we recommend seeking local advice from the hotel about where is safe to walk. Petty theft is unfortunately common in Nairobi and you should remain vigilant at all times.There will be a pre departure meeting tonight to meet your tour leader and fellow travellers. Please look out for information on reception.This morning we continue the adventure as we move onto Karatu - a town in northern Tanzania which makes for the perfect base to explore the Serengeti Nature Reserve and Ngorongoro Crater. After reaching Arusha, we say goodbye to the truck and transfer into 4WD vehicles to continue the last 2 hours to reach Karatu. Upon arrival you are free to relax before the exciting upcoming game drives. Karatu is a charming small town that\u2019s bursting with safari vehicles and keen safari goers. There is a great selection of restaurants and bars to spend the evening in too.A place that needs no introduction, the Serengeti National Park is the most famous safari destination in Africa. We\u2019re picked up after breakfast and taken by 4WD to the national park.The afternoon is spent game driving to our lodge, located inside the national park to maximise our time and wildlife viewing opportunities.Our second day in the park is a full morning of game driving, trying to spot the more elusive members of the animal kingdom before heading back to Karatu.Every safari is unique and you will never know what\u2019s in store for you until you arrive. Among the hundreds of species in the park, you may encounter zebra, giraffe, wildebeest, buffalo, lion, cheetah, leopard, hippopotamus, hyena, elephant, vulture, monkey, warthog, gazelle and impala. Each season offers a different highlight.This morning we will experience the stunning vista overlooking the Ngorongoro Crater, the largest unbroken, unflooded caldera in the world. The vast 300 square kilometre crater stretches out in front of you in a kaleidoscope of blues and greens and it\u2019s not until you spot the barely discernible grey speck of an elephant that you truly grasp its scale. We will also enjoy a game drive within the crater itself before continuing onto Arusha.Today we are bound for the enigmatic, intoxicating Isles of Zanzibar. We will transfer to Arusha Airport to take our flight to the paradise island. Arriving in Zanzibar we head to Stone Town where we will spend our first night on the Island.On arrival at our hotel in Stone Town you are free to explore the labyrinth of walled streets, winding alleys, bustling markets and grand crumbling architecture. This UNESCO-listed Stone Town has changed little over the past 200 years. If you enjoy shopping then there are plenty of crafts and colourful souvenirs to be purchased here. Admire the intriguingly decorated doors before sitting down to watch the sun set with a fresh juice, cold beer or cocktail. If the thought of fresh seafood gets the taste buds tingling, make sure you check out the excellent night market on the promenade which serves a feast not to be missed!Today we head to Nungwi Beach. On the way we will stop at one of the many spice plantations where we can discover the abundant plants that flourish in this verdant, tropical environment and sample spices picked straight from the source. We will also visit a small village, having the chance to interact with the locals and experience their kind hospitality; here we will enjoy a traditional lunch cooked by the community.We will arrive in Nungwi early afternoon and start enjoying this sun kissed paradise. Indulge in a cocktail or two while we watch the sunset over the crystal clear Indian Ocean.Today you are free to relax on the white coral sands or enjoy one of the many water based activities on the island. Snorkel with colourful marine life or simply kick back and soak up the sun. This beautiful setting will certainly provide you with a chance to relax and unwind!Your adventure of a lifetime comes to an end today.  If you have a late flight or have lengthened your stay by adding post tour accommodation you will have more time to explore the sights.Your adventure of a lifetime comes to an end today.
