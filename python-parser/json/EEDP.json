On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Croatia! Your tour begins with the 'Pearl of the Adriatic', the UNESCO World Heritage listed walled city of Dubrovnik.With a paved town centre enclosed in fortress-like 13th century stone walls, the city is easy to explore on foot and is full of character. A great start to your exploration of Dubrovnik could be with a walk around the city walls. Stretching almost 2 kilometres around the old town, the walls offer stunning rooftop and city views out to the turquoise blue Adriatic Sea. Founded in the 7th century, for a time in its glorious past the city was a serious rival for Venice in terms of maritime trade. It is hard to believe now but in 1991, two out of every three buildings were damaged during the bombardment of the Yugoslav War. Since then the buildings and walls have been painstakingly restored to pristine condition and represents one of the most beautiful and solid fortress systems on the Mediterranean. There are several other historic attractions worth a visit near the main street (Stradun), such as the 14th century Franciscan monastery which houses a treasury full of sacred art and artefacts, as well as one of the oldest continually working pharmacies in the world, dating back to 1317.With a wealth of cultural and water based activities, Dubrovnik will not fail in keeping you entertained. Try out sea kayaking in the crystal waters, or browse the markets in the Old Town for some Mediterranean delicacies. For some of the most incredible city views, head up the cable car to Mount Srd where you can view the city walls from a different perspective.We recommend booking pre tour accommodation or arriving on an early flight so that you can fully enjoy Dubrovnik and all the city has to offer. There will be a pre departure meeting at 6pm on the first day of the tour. Please check the hotel reception for details.Crossing the border into the 'heart-shaped land' of Bosnia and Herzegovina we visit the capital Sarajevo, a fascinating mixture of western and eastern cultures. Known as the 'Jerusalem of Europe', the city was once famous for its religious diversity, with people of Islamic, Orthodox Christian, Catholic and Jewish faiths coexisting relatively peacefully for centuries. The atmosphere of calm and tolerance changed dramatically when violence erupted in the mid-1990s and the city underwent the longest siege in modern military history during the Yugoslav War.Today the city is largely recovered and is packed with fascinating museums, bazaars, markets and bridges. During your time here you could explore the cobbled streets, mosques and Oriental style shops of the Old Town, visit the Bosnian Historical Museum to learn about the siege of Sarajevo and discover the Sarajevo Tunnel Museum, the tunnel which was used to ferry supplies into the besieged city during the conflict, next to the airport. For history buffs a must see is the \u201cLatin Bridge\" spanning the river in the downtown area. The bridge bears a plaque commemorating the assassination of Archduke of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Franz Ferdinand, the event that sparked the beginning of World War I.Today you are free to enjoy Sarajevo in your own time. You could explore the cobbled streets, mosques and Oriental style shops of the Old Town, visit the Bosnian Historical Museum to learn about the siege of Sarajevo and discover the Sarajevo Tunnel Museum, the tunnel which was used to ferry supplies into the besieged city during the conflict, next to the airport. For history buffs a must see is the \u201cLatin Bridge\" spanning the river in the downtown area. The bridge bears a plaque commemorating the assassination of Archduke of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Franz Ferdinand, the event that sparked the beginning of World War I.Famous for its outstanding natural beauty and charismatic vibe, Mostar is situated on the Neretva river and is the fifth-largest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The city is particularly famous for its beautiful single span bridge, Stari Most, which collapsed into the river during the Yugoslav War in 1993. Built in 1556 by the Ottoman ruler Suleiman the Great, Stari Most had been a globally recognised landmark and a national symbol for Bosnia-Herzegovina. It had survived centuries of conflict including both world wars and proved that, whatever happened, the mainly Christian west bank and mainly Muslim east remained united. The destruction of the bridge was a devastating event to the local people, but in 2004 the bridge was rebuilt as a replica of the original using pieces of masonry salvaged from the riverbed. Its reopening represented the hope that Muslims, Croats and Serbs could once again live side by side and that Mostar would be healed after a decade of ethnic division.Wonder the bazaar, stroll along the river and admire the quintessential Ottoman architecture, or take a short taxi drive to the beautiful Blagaj Tekke Monastery. End your evening in a quaint local restaurant overlooking the river. With influence from the Ottomans and Mediterranean, Bosnian cuisine is said to be some of the best in Eastern Europe.On the way to Croatia, we stop off at the Kravice waterfalls, located on the Trebiat river in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A popular spot for nature lovers, swimmers and photography buffs alike, you will have time to enjoy the area before heading to Hvar Island. Boasting more sunshine hours than any of the other sun-soaked Dalmatian islands, Hvar Island offers fairytale Venetian architecture, a waterfront promenade fringed by palm trees and centuries old walls. Arriving late afternoon, you will have the full day tomorrow to enjoy the various optional excursions available.Built by the Venetian Doges in the 13th century, Hvar Town is a maze of cobblestone streets and sunny squares bordered by al fresco cafes and restaurants. The most important sights such as St Stephen's Cathedral, Clock Tower and the Arsenal flank the main square, while a picturesque expanse of terracotta-roofed houses and tiny streets cover the hill behind.With all of this and an historic fortress overlooking it all, it's no wonder picturesque Hvar Town is considered a chic destination for the rich and famous, and you may be lucky enough to see one or two familiar faces here.Please note: Breakfast is not included in Hvar since we will be using local apartments and homestays. This is the best way to ensure the local community benefits from tourism to the island. Your tour leader will assist in pointing out the best spots for breakfast!Today you are free to enjoy the stunning island of Hvar. For a unique experience, take a boat trip to the glistening blue cave near the island of Vis. The stunning play of sunlight reflects on the white bottom of the cave, creating a glimmering blue light which lights up the cave and water.One of the simplest pleasures on the island is to take part in the evening stroll around the town and take in the views - don't forget to buy an ice cream from a local slasticarna, the Croatian equivalent of the Italian gelateria. You will have time to explore smaller villages of Stari Grad, Jelsa, taking in lavender fields, Vrboska and Brusje, wineries, eco villages and experiencing the local culture.Leaving the crystal blue waters of Hvar behind, we then take the ferry and arrive late morning at the coastal city of Split, built around the remains of the Diocletian Palace which we will visit on an included tour. The palace dates back to the Roman era. Wander inside and admire Peristil Square where you can see an original Egyptian sphinx which was brought from Egypt by Roman emperor Diocletian. Another sphinx can be found near St John's Church, which was originally a Roman temple.If you want to relax there are plenty of al fresco bars and restaurants to choose from along the seafront, as well as gelati bars and pizzerias off the main roads. End your day with some relaxation down at Bacvice beach, a popular spot with the locals.Continuing our diverse journey through Croatia, our next stop is to explore Plitvice National Park, a beautiful reserve featuring 16 spectacular blue lakes surrounded by forest and a highlight of any holiday to Croatia!The lakes are linked by natural dams which create beautiful low level waterfalls joining one lake to another. Due to the varying mixtures of minerals in the water, each lake has a distinctive colour ranging from azure to green, grey or blue. The surrounding forest features a mix of beech, spruce, and fir trees and is home to 126 species of birds and a number of rare animals including European brown bears, wolves, eagles, wild cats and eagles. Due to its natural beauty and significance,  the park was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1979. The entire park can be seen in about 4 hours and you can get beautiful views from almost any vantage point. Don't miss the Veliki Slap, 50 metre wide waterfall surrounded by boulders - a great place for photos.You will have this morning to continue taking in the beauty of the Plitvice Lakes, so we highly recommend getting up when the park opens to beat the crowds! After lunch we will then make our way to the next destination of Zagreb where you will have a free afternoon to explore the sights.Zagreb is a vibrant cultural centre with a long history, located on the crossroads of important routes between the Adriatic coast and Central Europe. Originally established as two fortresses on two neighbouring hills in medieval times, the city has withstood numerous invasions, earthquakes and political upheaval to grow into a prosperous centre of industry. In your free time you can explore Ban Jelacic Square surrounded by grand buildings or visit the Zagreb Cathedral with its fountain of Madonna surrounded by golden angels. You can visit colourful open-air markets such as Dolac Market and discover the historic Upper Town with its palaces, monasteries and churches from the 17th and 18th centuries. There are also dozens of museums, theatres, galleries and art collections to visit, or take a tram to the medieval fortress of Medvedgrad on the southern side of nearby Mount Medvednica for beautiful views over the city including Museum Mimara. Another interesting museum to see is the City of Zagreb Museum covering every facet of its long history. You could take a picnic to Maksimir Park about 3 kilometres from the city centre.Crossing into Slovenia, we stay in Bled, a magical little town about an hour and a half from Ljubljana, set near an emerald green lake. Perched on a cliff high above the lake is the Bled Castle, dramatically framed by the snowcapped peaks of the Julian Alps. Dating back to the 11th century, Bled Castle is the epitome of a medieval fortress and has a fairytale appeal, with towers, ramparts, moats and a terrace offering magnificent views. Part of the castle houses a museum with an interesting collection of armour and weapons, carvings, jewellery, tapestries and paintings which trace the history of the castle from the Bronze Age to the 19th century.A walk around Lake Bled (about 6 kilometres) shouldn't take more than an hour or two, including a short climb to a viewing point. The most romantic way to enjoy it is to hire a boat and row over to the island in the middle of the lake or for the non-rowers of the group you can take a Pletna boat and be taken across. On the island you can visit a small 17th century Baroque church called Church of the Assumption, complete with a wishing bell which you can ring to ask a favour. If time permits, you can also visit Vintgar Gorge, a raised timber walkway that tracks the gorges river for 1.6 kilometres to a beautiful waterfall.You could also kayak or paddleboard on the lake, enjoying some of the best views in Europe!Next we visit the capital Ljubljana. Arriving late morning, we will drop our luggage at the hotel and then head out on a guided city tour. Learn about the history, architecture and legends of Slovenia, as you admire the highlights such as Robba Fountain, Congress Square, Butchers Bridge, Dragon Bridge and the Town Square. After the tour you will be free to check into the hotel and enjoy your free afternoon.Ljubljana is the capital and largest city in Slovenia. As well as being the cultural, educational, economic and political centre since Slovenia gained independence in 1991, it is also a charming city with a whole host of activities. The cobbled streets are made for casual walks and the architecture quite intriguing.In your free time you may enjoy a visit to the botanical gardens, Dragon bridge, Tivoli Park, Ljubljana city museum, Ljubljana castle (Ljubljanski Grad) on Castle Hill and the viewing tower in the castle courtyard for views across the Old Town. When you need to relax, sit down at one of the many outdoor riverside cafes in the Old Town, check out the Habsburg and Baroque architecture and enjoy the young fun vibe of Ljubljana's large student population.You could also visit Metelkova Mesto, an autonomous cultural centre located in the old army barracks. Home to some fascinating street art as well as galleries and cafes, the area is bursting with culture and is one of the best known areas of the city.Taking the train through eastern Slovenia into Hungary, you can admire the countryside and watch the world go by. We will arrive into Budapest in the early evening. Hungary's stylish capital is known as the 'City of Spas' for its abundance of natural thermal springs. With a host of historical sights, buzzing nightlife and unique attractions, Budapest is a favourite for many travellers visiting the region.Straddling the Danube River, the city is comprised of two very different historic cities, Buda on the west bank and Pest on the east bank. Highlights here include Castle Hill, Matthias Church, Fisherman's Bastion, the Liberation Monument, the fabulous St Stephen's Basilica and the much photographed Parliament Building. An evening river cruise is an excellent way to see the parliament lit up at night.We will arrive to Budapest early evening.
