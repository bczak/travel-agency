On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to the capital of Egypt. Originally founded in 2,000 BC and known to be one of the largest cities in Africa, Cairo has established itself as a city of significant landmarks that began to emerge as a result of Roman rule in 30 BC. Journey via private vehicle deep into Arab culture and prepare to explore a city and country bursting with ancient history, grandeur and a fascinating way of living.Today is an arrival day and no activities are planned, however if you are arriving with enough time we recommend exploring the Cave Church in Cairo, which is one of the largest churches in the country as well as paying a visit to the Coptic Museum which is home to the largest collection of Egyptian Christian artifacts in the world. Note that you will be transferred from the airport to your joining hotel where there will be a pre-departure meeting held at approximately 6:00pm.If you have booked pre-tour accommodation through Tucan Travel then your arrival airport transfer will be included on the day you arrive in Cairo.Today we set off early. Crossing the River Nile, we head to Giza where we visit the famous  Pyramids and Sphinx. Here you will have some free time to explore these magnificent wonders.Considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, Egypt\u2019s majestic Pyramids were built to honour dead Pharaohs. The three great pyramids that are part of The Giza plateau date back from a period of construction between 3,800 and 2,800 BC and are located on the West bank of the River Nile because of the symbolism associating with the realm of the dead when the sun sets there in the evenings.After an exciting day of exploring these great ancient monuments you will head to the train station to board your overnight sleeper train to Aswan. Dinner will be included on the overnight train journey.This morning we arrive into Aswan station before heading to nearby Agilika Island to tour the romantic Philae Temples. Most notably, you will visit the Temple of Isis (in honour of the goddess). This classic Egyptian temple lies in between two dams at Aswan and can only be reached by boat.After visiting Philae Temple you will have the opportunity to visit the Aswan High Dam, an impressive engineering masterpiece which stands at an a whopping 364ft.If you would like to get a taste for the local flavour and culture then you have the opportunity to visit a local Nubian village and enjoy dinner and a show in one of the Nubian houses.Today you have the option visit the incredible great sun Temples of Abu Simbel. These temples are considered masterpieces of Ancient Egypt that were built for King Ramses II and Queen Nefertari both also reflecting the glory and grandeur of the new Kingdom. Both temples were discovered in 1813, after centuries of being buried under desert sands, but were then relocated in 1960 with the help of the Egyptian government and UNESCO to avoid the rising water of the Nile. A site not to be missed!Alternatively you can spend the morning relaxing before boarding your traditional felucca boat to embark on an unforgettable sailing adventure down the River Nile. You will depart from Aswan early afternoon, making your way to Kom Ombo. Lunch and dinner will be served on the felucca.Please note:  You will be required to bring your own sleeping bag for the felucca sailing experience.This morning you will disembark from the felucca and transfer to the site of the famous Kom Ombo temple. Overlooking the Nile, the Kom Ombo temple was built in dedication to the gods of Sobek (the Crocodile God) and Haroeris (the Falcon God), and has since become a popular part of Egyptian history that is visited by many for its grand inner halls and intricate wall carvings.After exploring Kom Ombo you continue to follow the River Nile by road. The next stop for today will be Edfu Temple. The Edfu temple contains both elements of Greek and New Kingdom temples. Here you will also get the chance to walk through the 37m high temple and explore its court and inner chapel.The adventure continues in the afternoon as you travel to Luxor, where you will have the next couple of days to explore the city and its surrounding attractions. The Luxor area is filled with more magnificent temples and valleys; you will find yourself at the very heart of ancient Egypt when visiting Luxor.We have included some important excursions in Luxor but not all as there is just so much to see and do and we want you to have the flexibility to see the things on your bucket list!A popular choice in the evening is to visit Karnak Temple for the \u2018Light and Sound\u2019 show. The light and sound show in the evening showcases the greatest achievements of some of the great Pharaohs as they come to life with accompanying music and light effects that you can experience as you wander through the complex.Please note: There are many optional excursions available in Luxor. It may not be possible to do all of them, however your Tour Leader will try to arrange them for you according to the best suitable times.Deep within the valley opposite modern Luxor lies the royal burial complex known as The Valley of the Kings. This morning you will have an included excursion to Valley of the Kings. The valley holds over 60 tombs that were once surrounded by a plethora of Egyptian treasures, the most notable being the final resting ground for King Tutankhamun which visitors can see. Admission to the Valley of the Kings complex is included, but entrance to the actual tombs will be at an additional cost if you dare to enter!After visiting the Valley of the Kings our next stop will be Colossi of Memnon. These gigantic statues have survived for 3,400 years in the hot desert sun and are visited by many despite the condition of the statues being affected by weather conditions.This afternoon you will have time to explore some of the many options available in the Luxor area. Your tour leader will be on hand to assist you in arranging these excursions. Maybe you would prefer to take a little relaxation time or perhaps soak up the atmosphere at the Luxor bazaar (Souk)? A visit to the souk is a real insight into local life, you will see traders selling local produce, household utensils, tools and other goods as well as  jewellery, bags, leather goods, souvenirs, spices, scarves and all sorts of other trinkets and treasures.Today you have a free morning to continue exploring. If you have a head for heights why not opt for the scenic hot air balloon journey over the ancient and historical sites of Luxor? This excursion can be arranged locally and is subject to availability. Please note that the operation of this excursion is weather dependant.If you have not already visited then this is also a good time to visit the Karnak temple which is known to be one of the world\u2019s greatest ancient sites. The temple itself contains two museums - the Mummification museum where you can learn more about the ancient process of mummification and the Luxor museum displaying a small but impressive collection of ancient Egyptian artefacts.Alternatively it is also worth opting to visit the ancient temple of Hatshepsut which differs to others due to its classical style of architecture. After a busy morning of exploration we depart Luxor as we hop on an overnight train returning to Cairo.This morning we arrive back at our original starting point in Cairo. After checking into our hotel, we head back out to visit the Egyptian Museum. Here is where you will come face-to-face with more ancient treasures and if you are lucky you will get to view the infamous Gold Death Mask of Tutankhamun.Our day of culture continues as we make our way towards Cairo\u2019s oldest church, also known as The Hanging Church and the nearby Ben Ezra Synagogue. We also stop at the 19th Century Mosque of Muhammad Ali (also known as Saladin Citadel) to admire grand structure and take in some great views of Cairo.Time dependant, you may also have some free time to explore Cairo a little more this afternoon. Tonight will be your last night on tour and you will be free to enjoy this as you wish, however our Tour Leader will be happy to arrange a final group dinner for everyone who wishes to join.Your adventure of a lifetime comes to an end today.  If you have a late flight or have lengthened your stay by adding post tour accommodation you will have more time to explore the sights.Your adventure of a lifetime comes to an end today.
