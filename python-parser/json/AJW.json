On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Johannesburg and the start of your tour. You are free to arrive today at your leisure \u2013 please note that there will be a pre departure meeting tonight at 6pm to meet your tour leader and group.Johannesburg is the largest city in South Africa and gateway to Kruger National Park where we will depart for tomorrow. Our hotel is located a short ten minute drive from O.R Tambo International Airport and comes with a swimming pool to relax in after your flight.We have an early morning start to get to Kruger National Park where we search for the big five. The journey will take around six hours. Upon arrival we will immediately enjoy an afternoon game drive to start viewing the animals that call the reserve home.Kruger National Park is South Africa's premier game reserve, regarded as one of the finest in Africa. Here you'll have the chance to experience the vast diversity of wildlife as we explore some of the two million hectares of the park. The big five game animals of Africa are richly represented here \u2013 lion, leopard, African buffalo, African elephant and the white rhino in large numbers.This morning you will enjoy another game drive spotting more animal action in the national park. Learn all about the history of the park and animals and why conservation of these fantastic creatures is so important.We will depart Kruger National Park and take a flight to one of Africa\u2019s greatest attractions and one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world. With a length of over one kilometre and a height of over one hundred metres this magnificent natural wonder of cascading water defines the border separating Zimbabwe & Zambia. Depending on the wind direction you can hear the roar from the falls up to 4km away as it surges into Africa\u2019s fourth biggest river, the mighty Zambezi.Tonight we will stay close to the action in the town of \u2018Victoria Falls\u2019You have a full free day to enjoy Victoria Falls and its activities.Today is a further free day to explore Victoria Falls and enjoy the abundance of activities on offer. Wonder the craft markets and pick up some unique souvenirs or chose from one of the many optional activities available in this area. Whether it be sunset cruises down the Zambezi, a visit to the Mukuni Cultural Village, riverboarding, white water rafting, canoeing, horse riding, abseiling, quad biking, kayaking, helicopter or microlight flights over the falls there is something for everyone.Next we head to Botswana. We stay close to Chobe National Park which is home to the most diverse wildlife in Botswana. 11,000 square kilometres of wilderness, floodplains, forests and swamps support all manners of animal and birdlife. To gain a different perspective of the animals we embark on a sunset cruise along the Chobe River. Wildlife is plentiful and common along the water\u2019s edge; as we glide by you may see elephants, buffalos, kudu, bushbuck, hippo, giraffe and sable.Located in north west Botswana, Chobe is a diverse area spanning from the border at the Chobe River, to the now dry Savute Channel and beyond to the borders of the Moremi Game Reserve and Okavango Delta. The park is divided into four distinctly different eco systems: Serondela with its lush plains and dense forests in the Chobe River area, the Savuti Marsh, the Linyanti Swamps and the dry hinterland and it is famous for having one of the largest game concentrations in the African continent.Our next stop is spent in a very unique location. You will be staying at Elephant Sands, a bush lodge set on private conservancy in the north-east part of Botswana. It is home to a huge amount of wildlife that roams free, especially elephants. You can enjoy the swimming pool and if you are lucky catch a sighting of one of these gentle giants! Elephant Sands is located near two water holes which are only a few feet away.You will be staying in stilted tented camps and can enjoy a cocktail or two in the Elephant Sands bar.Driving across the top edge of the Kalahari Desert we reach the town of Maun, which will be our gateway for visiting the Okavango Delta, Africa's largest freshwater wetland.The Okavango Delta is a huge area of very slow flowing water fed by the Kavango River. The water fans out from the river into a labyrinth of channels, lagoons and palm-covered islands before evaporating over the sands of the Kalahari Desert.Today we will take a day trip to the small islands in the bush. We will travel by hand-crafted mokoros (small boats with shallow drafts similar to canoes) through the delta. The canoes glide silently along the reed-fringed waterways, steered by stealthy polers who earn their living transporting travellers along the delta. We will also have walking safaris through the bush and a chance for a swim before returning to the hotel in Maun.Departing Maun we drive through Botswana towards Namibia and cross the border through a narrow strip of land known as the Caprivi Strip. Keep your eyes peeled as we drive through Mahango Game Reserve as you may be lucky enough to spot zebra, giraffe, gazelle and elephants among other wildlife.Etosha National Park is one of the most memorable places you will visit on this trip with huge amounts of wildlife visiting the waterholes to drink. We have a full game drive to make the most of the fantastic wildlife-spotting opportunities.Today is a full day of driving to reach Etosha where you will enjoy a game drive tomorrow.Etosha National Park is one of the best places in Africa to spot cheetahs and the endangered black rhino. Keep your camera lens ready for rare antelope species, the Burchell's zebra and black-faced impala's which roam the wild savannah. You may spot the odd giraffe or two chewing through thorny acacia trees in the woodland areas. Etosha National Park is a bird watcher's paradise with some 340 species inhabiting the park at different times of the year. For a short period after seasonal rains Etosha's vast salt pan is covered by a layer of water which attracts massive flocks of pelicans, flamingoes and other wading birds. While the pan is dry it is notable for the way it dramatically changes colour during the early morning and late afternoon sun.This morning we leave the Etosha National Park area and make our way towards Otjiwarongo. We travel through the Namibian landscape for around four hours to reach the Cheetah Sanctuary where we will stop for a few hours. After arrival to the sanctuary we will enjoy an introduction to the centre and the work that they do, including a tour of the centre, museum, clinic and creamery. You will witness the cheetahs being fed and also meet the other livestock that live in the centre.Following this you can enjoy an optional Cheetah drive excursion where you have the opportunity to witness these beautiful creatures up close.Later in the afternoon we have a short drive to our final destination for the night, Otjiwarongo.Our next stop will be the charming coastal town of Swakopmund, a historic colonial German town surrounded by desert and sweeping sand dunes which meet with the Atlantic Ocean. It is Namibia's most popular holiday destination. We spend two nights here, so you can wander around town viewing the colonial architecture or perhaps enjoy a cold locally brewed beer or two. If you would prefer to fuel your thirst for adrenaline then there is a wide range of optional excursions available. The town also has a good selection of bars and restaurants to cater for every taste. The seafood here is great!Today you are free to enjoy more of Swakopmund.Departing the coast we drive towards the Tropic of Capricorn where we make a stop so that you can get that obligatory picture with the sign. From here we continue on to Solitaire, a small settlement in the Khomas Region of Central Namibia, close to the Namib-Naukluft National Park. This small desert community has only a gas station, post office, bakery and general store. As you step off the truck you will feel as though you have stepped back in time onto a movie set, surrounded by cacti and old vehicle carcasses partially submerged in the sand.An early start this morning as we make for our excursion into Sossusvlei and Dead Vlei - home of the iconic sand dunes in Namibia. After our excursion we will make our way towards Windhoek.At an elevation of 1650 metres, Windhoek lies in a beautiful valley and is surrounded by the Eros Mountains in the north and the Auas mountains to the south. This is the only city in Namibia and is home to a population of over 250,000 inhabitants. Like in Swakopmund there is a noticeable German influence here. German is still widely spoken and it is common to find traditional breads, sausage, and other delicacies, they even hold annual beer festivals.No tourist's visit to Windhoek is complete without paying a visit to Joe\u2019s Beer house, a bar and restaurant providing a mix of warm Namibian and German hospitality. This place is full of old relics from \u2018Joe\u2019s\u2019 travels and creates a great atmosphere for socialising and reminiscing about your journey so far. Here you can also opt to sample some delicious game meats or try out one of the many craft beers on offer.Your adventure of a lifetime comes to an end today.  If you have a late flight or have lengthened your stay by adding post tour accommodation you will have more time to explore the sights.Your adventure of a lifetime comes to an end today.
