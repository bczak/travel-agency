On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Delhi is India's bustling capital, political and cultural centre, with a population of almost 13 million and is bound to be a city that keeps you on your toes no matter what time of day it is!Many dynasties have ruled here and they have all left their own legacies in the architecture, culture and monuments. The city has been destroyed and rebuilt seven times in its long history. Distances are long in the city and walking to places can be futile. Take a bike rickshaw or a motorised rickshaw to get around some of the sites. You can visit the Gandhi Memorial Museum or the infamous Red Fort, maybe make your way to Humayun's Tomb in south Delhi, near Hazrat Nizamuddin station, one of Delhi's three UNESCO World Heritage Sites. A popular way to discover Delhi for many people is to take a bicycle rickshaw tour and check out the view from Jama Masjid, the largest mosque in India.Included on your tour is an orientation walk through the Karol Bagh area in Delhi.We visit Bikaner in the north, the home of the impressive Junagarh Fort surrounded by what was once an elaborate moat. Bikaner is also referred to as an 'oasis town'. Here you could visit Lalgarh Palace, which is a red sandstone building surrounded by sand dunes and rocks. Outside of Bikaneer lies one of the most unusual attractions, the Karni Mata Temple, where some 2000 rats reside. The rats are seen as holy and are revered and they protected because it is believed that they have souls of the followers of Karni Mata in them. Thousands of Hindu pilgrims visit the temple every year to pay their respects to Karni Mata and her followers.We venture deep into the desert to Jaisalmer, 'the golden city', where you'll see that there is no shortage of markets, each in fierce competition with each other! Jaisalmer's main attraction is its medieval mud fortress, which is the only fort in the whole of India that still has people living in it today.From Jaisalmer we take an overnight camel safari into the Thar Desert, which is a great way to unwind after experiencing the hustle and bustle of urban Indian life. From here we begin our journey into the photogenic Thar Desert by vehicle. This region is sparsely populated by some of India's most colourful and resourceful people, such as Bhati Rajputs, who are descended from an ancient warrior called Bhatti. We then reach the vast sand dunes where we will begin our overnight camel safari, which will give you the opportunity to experience desert life from a camel's back. Camel breeding is a common practice in this area. You will meet with your village herdsman and the camel which you will ride on the way to the camp. We venture out into the golden sea of sand and will have the chance to see nomadic herders, remote parts of the Thar Desert, rolling sand dunes and desert villages. We will camp under the stars and have a traditional meal cooked for us.The following day we continue our journey back to civilisation. The scenery becomes more fertile and densely populated as we head back Jaisalmer.Busy Jodhpur is Rajasthan's second largest city, dominated by its spectacular Mehrangarh fort. Located in Western Rajasthan you'll see endless golden dunes, camels slowly trekking into the distance and desert landscapes as far as the eye can see.You will have ample free time for sightseeing. If you take the option to visit the Majestic Fort, you will see why Jodphur is known as the 'Blue City'; many houses in the old city are painted blue and you can admire this amazing view from the fort.

It is one of the most popular cities in the region with its placid lakes and green gardens. This is a truly captivating city and as a result it has been dubbed 'the most romantic city in India'. Surrounded by beautiful lakes, marble palaces and stunning gardens, Udaipur will most likely offer a refreshing change to the desert surrounds you have seen so far. It provides an insight into the variety and geographical diversity that characterises India. Udaipur is also home to one of the most luxurious hotels in India, the Lake Palace, which is the former Maharajas Palace in the middle of the lake.Today is a free day.

There's also the popular Nahargarh (Tiger Fort) which is a small fort with towering walls.

The rest of the day is free to wander through the old city with its maze of narrow alleyways, and visit the temples of one of the oldest and longest inhabited cities in the world.Today we travel down the dusty roads to Lumbini which lies in the foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal. Lumbini is said to be the place where Gautama Buddha 'the apostle of peace and the light of Asia' was born in 623 B.C. The most important temple at Lumbini is the Maya Devi Temple, marking the traditional site of the Buddha's birth. The temple stands on the site of earlier temples and has been a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of years.
