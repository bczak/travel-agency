On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Peru! Your adventure starts here in Lima and you are free to arrive today at your leisure.Lima was founded by the Spanish Conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 1535 after he eradicated the Incas and made the city his capital. The city has many beautiful colonial buildings and some of the best museums in South America including the Gold Museum, Museum of the Inquisition and the Catacombs below the San Francisco Church.Peru's capital has much to offer and many of the sights, including the city's two main squares the Plaza de Armas and Plaza San Martin, boast some fantastic sightseeing opportunities. The Plaza de Armas houses the Cathedral, Municipal Palace and Presidential Palace where the changing of the guard can be seen every day at 12 noon.Another highlight of Lima is the Huaca Pucllana, ruins of a pre-Incan pyramid. The clay structure, built in seven staggered levels is one of the few that remain from the historic pre-Colombian period in Peru. It is thought to have been built around 500 AD and would have been used for spiritual ceremonies. Located in the Miraflores district, it's surprisingly very easy to get it!Of course you should also spend time sampling some delicious local Peruvian food. For a breakdown of the best food in Peru and where to eat in Lima, click hereNo trip to Peru would be complete without a visit to what is considered the most biodiverse place on earth, the lush and beautiful Amazon rainforest. Covering nearly two thirds of the country, the area is home to around 600 species of birds, 1200 types of butterflies and 300 reptiles, to name a few. As eco-tourism continues to grow, there are a number of eco lodges allowing you to experience the rainforest in the most responsible and authentic way possible.We will transfer to the airport for our flight to the jungle community of Puerto Maldonado, the starting point for our visit to the Amazon rainforest. Here you can pick up last minute drinks and snacks before the group continue with a short bus ride followed by riverboat journey to reach the accommodation for the night. Sailing along the river, the trip takes around 2 hours and is an excellent chance to relax and start to take in the magic of the rainforest.Arriving at your riverside lodge, check in and have some time to relax before an afternoon of exploring. After lunch we will set off on a trek through the rainforest along wooden walkways. On the way our guide will stop to show you various species of bird and explain the medicinal plants and delicate ecological systems of the Amazon Jungle. The scenery is extremely varied incorporating dense jungle as well as marsh areas. You will see incredibly big trees, several metres in diameter and around 450 years old. We walk to Cochita Caiman (Caiman Pond) where we see wildlife along the way. We then return to the lodge for dinner.Please note: The eco-lodges in the Amazon jungle are designed to give travellers the most authentic jungle experience while limiting disruption to the animals and plantlife. The bungalows are built from local indigenous materials with the rooms sealed by mesh netting to keep mosquitoes out. All rooms have private bathroom facilities however these are basic and hot water can be limited. There is portable water available at the lodge therefore we recommend taking a reusable water bottle with you. Electricity is limited and it is advisable to bring portable chargers for your electronics and ensure they are fully charged. After dark, the walkways are lit by oil lamps. The lodges include a welcome area, dining room and bar, meaning there are plenty areas for your group to relax and socialise. Single supplements are not available in the bungalows. If you have further questions on what to expect, your tour leader will be happy to assist. All excursions in the jungle are led by an English speaking guide.After an early breakfast we hike deeper in to the jungle, enjoying the surroundings and exploring the delights and hidden wonders of the Amazon Rainforest. We may also catch a glimpse of the rare giant otter. Afterwards we will enjoy the view of the lake from our viewing point/observation platform, where you can experience the canopy wildlife such as parrots, guacamayos, toucans, camungos, shanshos, herons, turtles and caiman. We will return to the lodge for a well deserved lunch.After a break and some yummy food, we take a short boat trip across the Madre de Dios River to Monkey Island. On the way over you may spot caiman from the boat. Once on the island it is possible to see a great variety of monkeys such as the \u2018maquisapa\u2019, black and white \u2018Martins\u2019, \u2018Leoncito de la Selva\u2019 (Little Lions), \u2018Frailes\u2019 (Friars), \u2018Achu\u00f1is\u2019, \u2018Ronsocos\u2019 as well as an array of birdlife. In the evenings it is often possible to enjoy the wonderful sunset, one of the most impressive sights of the forest (weather permitting).Enjoy your final night in the heart of the jungle soaking up this magical and peaceful atmosphere.Today we fly to Cusco and you have the rest of the day to relax and explore some of it's charm. While the city is usually seen as the gateway to the iconic Machu Picchu, Cusco is well worth exploring in itself.Discover the Plaza de Armas, the cultural centre of the city and where you can find many bars, restaurants and local coffee shops. Visit the Cathedral, which was built with blocks from the nearby Inca site of Sacsaywam\u00e1n and took almost a century to complete.Spend the evening relaxing and acclimatising to the altitude, maybe picking up a bag of coca leaves to make some tea, the locals swear by this!A full day is spent visiting the Sacred Valley of the Incas. At an altitude of 3800m we take slow walks that take up to an hour, around each of the ruins in order to manage any effects the high altitude may have. Firstly we visit the Pisac ruins, perched on a hilltop with incredible views of the surrounding mountains. We then go down to the famous traditional market of the same name, which is full of colour and atmosphere. A great place for souvenirs! After lunch, we continue along the valley to the temple/fortress of Ollantaytambo with its enormous Inca terracing constructed on the side of a steep mountain.Tonight you will stay in the town of Ollantaytambo.Having stayed overnight in Ollantaytambo, it means we have a short bus ride to the starting point of the trek. The first day is a relatively easy 4\u00bd hour and 13 kilometre walk. With mostly flat and light climbs, you start to witness the lush scenery of Peru. Walking slowly, you will have plenty of short breaks to ensure the group are acclimatising to the altitude.The Inca Trail Trek can be demanding but can be completed by anyone who leads a reasonably active life - you certainly don\u2019t need to be an athlete. Everyone is able to walk at their own pace and there is no rush to finish. The trekking group is led by an expert local guide and supported by a team of porters and cooks, leaving you with only a small day pack to carry. If you are in any doubt or if you have any condition that may affect your ability to trek, we advise that you consult your doctor.Please Note: Due to a limited number of people being allowed on the trail a day, permits are limited and can sell out far in advance. If you wish to book the Inca Trail, please provide your Reservations Agent with your passport details by email as soon as possible so that we can secure your permit. Without your passport details, we are unable to arrange your Inca Trail Trek. Alternatively you can opt to participate in the challenging but rewarding 1 day Inca trek. Please speak to one of our travel consultants for more information or you can read more about it here. If you are not participating in either trek then you will visit Machu Picchu by train and then have plenty of free time to enjoy the activities available in and around Cusco. Meals are included for those doing the Inca Trail Trek. If you are choosing not to do the Inca Trail Trek, you will have 2-3 days to spend exploring Cusco.Today is the biggest challenge on the trek as you reach the highest pass at Warmiwa\u00f1usca, also known as Dead Woman\u2019s Pass! Sitting at 4,200 metres, it is nearly 1,800 metres higher than Machu Picchu itself. The terrain here is slightly more rockier and due to open area, trekkers are more exposed to the elements, whether it\u2019s the rain lashing down or the sun blazing down! However it can be said that traversing this part of the trail is the second most rewarding part, just after seeing Machu Picchu itself.You will cover approximately nine kilometres in about 5-7 hours and after the high pass it's all downhill as the trail winds its way along old Inca stairs to our campsite.Today you will cover the most distance, at 15 kilometres you will walk for around 7 hours. While being the longest day, it is also the most interesting as you pass more ruins and unique sites. After roughly one hour of trekking you will come to the ruins of Runkurakay, a small circular shaped archaeological site. It has been said this site was most likely used as resting point for the Inca messengers, who maintained communication across the Inca Empire.From this point, it is mostly downhill, and we have four more ruin sites to be discovered, with the next being Sayacmarca. Also known to historians as the \u201cinaccessible town\u201d due to it being barricaded on three sides with steep mountain drop offs, archaeologists remain baffled as to what the site was used for. Some say it was a viewing and control point for those headed to Machu Picchu.We continue onto Phuyupatamarca where you can enjoy some amazing views from the top. The Quechua translation being \u201ctown in the clouds\u201d it offers some great photo opportunities and is often used as a lunch spot for groups.On the last morning of the Inca Trail Trek, after an overnight stop at Wi\u00f1ay-Wayna, you will rise early for the final walk to Machu Picchu and greet daybreak over the famous \u201cSun Gate\u201d. There will then be time to explore on your own or simply take in the magnificence of the place after your guided tour.The Lost City of Machu Picchu was originally completely self-contained, surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to feed the population, and watered by natural springs. Located high above the fast flowing Urubamba River, the cloud shrouded ruins have palaces, baths, temples, storage rooms and some 150 houses, all in a remarkable state of preservation that will simply take your breath away.The ruins were only discovered by the outside world in 1911, when American explorer Hiram Bingham found them while looking for another \u201clost city\u201d called Vilcabamba. Due to their isolation many of the buildings are still quite intact and you can't help but admire Huayna Picchu (\u201cYoung Mountain\u201d), which towers above the ruins.After spending most of the day at Machu Picchu you have the chance to meander through the markets of Aguas Calientes before enjoying a scenic train ride back to the Sacred Valley where our transfer to Cusco will be waiting.Today is free to relax and explore some more of Cusco. Take a walking tour and admire the colonial buildings or wander the colourful San Pedro Market, where you can find fruits and vegetables in abundance as well as other local delicacies.A 45 minute walk from the centre lies Sacsayhuaman, another ancient Inca site that is well worth the journey for both the incredible views of Cusco and the interesting stonework. You can also catch a glimpse of Cristo Blanco, the large statue of Christ that towers above the city.Spend the evening back at Plaza de Armas and experience Cusco after dark. With plenty quaint restaurants and vibrant bars around, the plaza is as lively as during the day.Leaving Cusco, we'll drive along roads abundant with herds of llamas, alpacas and vicu\u00f1as before reaching the Altiplano (high plain) where our journey takes us past hot mineral pools, snow capped mountains and through villages where the locals sell food, fur hats and alpaca sweaters.The beautiful scenery is continual all the way to Puno on the shores of Lake Titicaca, which at 3,855 metres above sea level, is the highest navigable lake in the world.Today we take a day trip to the traditional and enthralling Lake Titicaca. Not only is it the largest lake in South America, it sits at 3,800 meters above sea level making it the highest navigable body of water on earth. Crystal blue waters compliment the bright yellow grass reeds used to construct the homes and boats floating upon it, while the traditional clothing simply adds to the beauty and colour of the place. While the lake tends to be overshadowed by its biodiverse and world famous neighbour the Amazon jungle, there exists over 500 aquatic species here and many various birds.First we visit the floating reed islands in the Bay of Puno to see the Uros islanders way of life and we will have the option to ride in a traditional reed boat.Next stop is Taquile Island, an island on Lake Titicaca still holding up many of the traditions values and customs it was built on. Learn about the way of life, from the reasons for why they do their hair the way they do and how they dress. Famous for their textiles and clothing, you will be able to pick up a homemade gift or two from the main square.We will return to Puno for the evening.We journey by public bus into La Paz which is built in a steep valley that protects the city from the harsh elements of the Altiplano. Just about every building in La Paz is built on some sort of hill, so sightseeing will literally take your breath away! You will have time to explore La Paz and it's bustling atmosphere. Our hotel is very centrally located and is just around the corner from the city's colourful indigenous street markets including the fascinating and suitably named ?Witches Market'? where local women in traditional 'Cholita' dress sell such items as dead cats and llamas foetuses said to ward off evil spirits. The main square, Plaza Murillo, is also within walking distance. The square still retains its colonial buildings including the Presidential Palace.Today is a free day to enjoy the sights and sounds of La Paz. For a cheap thrill and a birds eye view of the expansive city why not hop on the Telef&#233;rico, the most extensive urban transport project in the world!Today we fly to the town of Uyuni, a remote corner of southwestern Bolivia and gateway to the mesmerising salt flats. Originally started as a trading post between Chili, the city is home to a small population of around 11,000 people yet welcomes close to 70,000 travellers every year who are eager to see the largest salt flat area in the world. On a clear day, the views from the plane are magical, as we fly over the huge expanse that is the Altiplano, to the Andes as you see the landscape slowly start to flatten.Spend the afternoon relaxing in this quaint town and wander the street markets, try some local dishes or simply observe local life.Please note: During the winter months of May-August temperatures of the Altiplano can be extremely cold, so please be prepared and pack warm clothes.This morning we embark on an exhilarating three day tour to explore the Salar de Uyuni, otherwise known as the largest salt flat area in the world. Using 4WD vehicles, we also visit some of the most beautiful landscapes that surround the area. First on the agenda is a stop at the eery Train Cemetery, a graveyard of early 19th and 20th century steam locomotives. Perfect for some unique and artistic photographs, the cemetery represents how important Uyuni once was as a transportation hub. Next stop is Colchani, which is a small, one street town at the edge of the salt flats. Acting as the main plant for the iodisation of salt and the best place to observe the methods of salt extraction from the salar, Colchani annually processes around 25,000 tonnes of salt (out of the estimated 10 billion tonnes the Salar de Uyuni holds!)The largest salt flat in the world, the brilliant white vast Salar de Uyuni covers some 10,500 square kilometres and looks like a surreal piece of art. With seemingly infinite horizons in front of you, the dream like atmosphere amazes visitors again and again.After free time to take as many illusion like photos as possible, we then visit either Fish Island or Incahuasi Island, depending on the season. Located in the centre of the Salar, 100 kilometres from Uyun\u00ed, this hilly outpost is covered in giant cacti amid a flat, white sea of hexagonal salt tiles. On a clear sunny day, the blue skies complimenting the white grounds will be a view like no other.Please note: Occasionally in the rainy season the salt flats become overly flooded and we may have to alter the itinerary if the salt flats are not safe to traverse. Your tour leader will advise as early as possible if this is likely to happen on your tour.We continue south on our epic 4WD expedition, into some of the most remote areas of the Bolivian Altiplano. You will see a variety of dramatic landscapes including smoking volcanoes, barren deserts and gravity-defying rock formations carved by the wind. In this incredibly empty landscape you'll most likely feel the furthest from civilisation you've ever been. You will visit  a number of lagoons including Ca\u00f1apa, Chairkota and Laguna Honda. You will also get to see the Laguna Colorada, which offers some truly breathtaking scenery, with several varieties of flamingos gathering in the shallow waters of the beautiful crimson lagoon. Before arriving at Laguna Colorada you will pass Arbol de Piedra, the famous Stone Tree.Please Note:The temperatures can get very cold and often drop below zero when crossing the Bolivian Altiplano, especially the winter months from May to September. You may wish to bring a sleeping bag if traveling in the winter months. A sleeping bag can also be rented from your Tour Leader for 70 Bolivian Bolivianos. Also note that on occasion in winter snow can cause the itinerary to be altered at short notice.Please Note:The accommodation here is basic with limited facilities. Please see your tour notes for further details.Today we leave Bolivia behind and head for Chile. We make our way to San Pedro de Atacama, making a few stops on the way. We visit the volcanic zone \u2018Sol de Ma\u00f1ana' (Morning Sun) at 4,850 metres above sea level. Here you'll discover a geyser basin with bubbling mud pots, hellish fumaroles and a thick aroma of sulphur fumes. Inside a small crater we will observe mud bubbling away and we will also stop at hot springs where you can bathe. We will pass the Desert of Salvador Dali before crossing a 5,000 metre pass. We then come to the beautiful Laguna Verde, which is shadowed by the cone of the Licancabur Volcano. Next to Laguna Verde is Laguna Blanca, known as the White Lake. Continuing on we will cross into Chile. On the way we get the chance to see both the Bolivian and Chilean sides of the 5960m Licancabur Volcano.We then come to San Pedro de Atacama in the world's driest desert. The area is famous for the salt-covered lunar landscapes, geysers, salt flats and hot springs of the Valley of the Moon, which we will explore by van tomorrow.Please Note: Upon exiting Bolivia you will be required to pay a small fee of 20 Bolivianos.San Pedro de Atacama is a picturesque small town that looks like it has come straight from the scene of a Western with its single-storey buildings, white-washed walls and dusty roads. Due to its remote location and dry climate, the Atacama desert offers some of the clearest skies in the world and as such is used by international space agencies to monitor the skies. If you are lucky enough to have clear nights during your stay in San Pedro de Atacama, the starscape will most likely be the best you'll ever see.Today we enjoy an excursion to the Valley of the Moon. The various stone formations have been formed by the wind and rain over time, resulting in unique and interesting shapes, similar to the surface of the moon. In fact, it is said a prototype of the Mars rover was tested in the area!Next we head to the sprawling metropolis of Santiago. Nestled in central Chile, the city is framed by the tall and snow capped Andes mountains which on a clear day give the city the most stunning backdrop.Santiago is a very clean, modern city with many fountains and parks, but also has its own turbulent history. It is well-known for its fresh markets such as the famous La Vega Central Market, and the Mercado Central, one of the best seafood markets in the world. You can see the changing of the guard most days outside the impressive Palacio de La Moneda, the seat of the President of Chile. In the 1970s, the palace was bombarded during the military coup d'\u00e9tat, ushering in a dark period in Chile\u2019s national history.For the best views of the city, take a funicular railway or hike to the top of San Cristobal, where the Statue of the Virgin overlooks the capital and the distant Andes. Here you can taste some of Chile's best wines and find some beautifully situated swimming pools.Please Note: We will depart early to maximise our time in Santiago, therefore breakfast is not included on this day.Today is free for you to further explore Santiago. Why not visit los Dominicos village, a traditional market which offers an array of Chilean artisan goods and textiles. Wander the shops and pick up some unique souvenirs or perch yourself outside a coffee shop and try catch some of the live musicians who often play in the area.Other interesting places to visit are the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, an impressive fine art gallery housed in a colossal neoclassical building, and the Cementerio General, a huge cemetery with large mausoleums including that of the former president Salvador Allende Gossens. Also worth a visit is the Plaza de Armas, the centrepiece of the city, which is bordered on one side by the impressive Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago, completed in the 19th century.If you would like to experience a more tranquil area of Chile, you may wish to take an optional excursion to the Chilean coast, about two hours\u2019 drive from Santiago. You can wander around the creative port city of Valparaiso, which has a lively tradition of imaginative street art and painted murals, or you can relax in the upmarket beach resort of Vi\u00f1a del Mar, trying exquisite seafood in stylish restaurants that look out onto the Pacific Ocean.Tonight there will be a PDM at 6pm to meet your new tour leader and group members who are starting their Patagonia adventure here in Santiago.Today starts our Patagonian adventure. We fly into the quaint and colourful town of Punta Arenas, the urban capital of the Magallanes province and gateway to Patagonia.Highlights include visiting the Cerro de la Cruz which gives you a view of the city, the bay and the colourful houses as well as an old shipwreck just off the shore at the southern end of town, called Lord Lonsdale Shipwreck which has been around for 100 years.Don't forget to go for a beer, a Cerveza Austral to be exact, as it's one of the most famous and best Chilean beers!Today enjoy an included excursion to the small island of Magdalena. After a boat ride to the island you will come face-to-face with the largest penguin colonies that you can find south of Chile. The island remains largely untouched and holds an abundance of natural beauty, with barren landscapes and vast ocean views. Hundreds of penguins roam free and are unfazed when visitors walk through the island, perfect for some amazing photo opportunities!Here you can also find the historic lighthouse, which houses interesting information about the island and local history.Back on the mainland you can dine on the freshest seafood from crab to oysters in one of the many seafront restaurants.Please Note: Availability of the included Penguin Excursion depends on local weather conditions, and can on occasion be cancelled without notice. In the case of cancellation we will include a guided visit to see the impressive Andean condors and their nesting ground.This morning we hop on-board the overland truck and take to the great outdoors in the heart of Torres Del Paine National Park. While the drive is long, the scenery is beautiful and we will make regular stops for bathrooms and viewpoints.Complete with jaw-dropping landscapes and emerald forests, the area is an internationally recognised UNESCO World Heritage site. Located on the Chilean side of Patagonia, it measures an astonishing 181 000 hectares. The area is home to various animals including condors,  huemul (South Andean deer), and the llamas closest cousin, the guanaco. Once endangered, around 3000 now call the vast park their home and you will be sure to see a few on your walks.Upon arrival, we will settle into the campsite and our team will show you how to set up the tents. You are then free to walk around the area, taking in all the natural beauty. We recommend walking down to the lake where on a clear day, offers spectacular views of the mountains.Please Note: We camp for three nights in Torres del Paine National Park. Solo travellers will share a tent with a group member of the same sex. Facilities are basic however there is an inside bar, small shop, 24/7 hot water and proper toilets. We recommend bringing a portable battery pack for your devices for these days, however the truck does also have USB charging points.

All meals are included while camping including a three course dinner.Today enjoy a full day exploring the national park with various guided walks and other optional activities on offer. There are many guided walks on offer which showcase the best of the national park and where you can witness some amazing mountain views.Some of the walks are quite demanding, and at a high altitude, but there are a good range of options for all grades of walkers. One such trek offers incredible views of the famous \u2018towers\u2019, the three distinctive granite peaks of the Paine mountain range. It\u2019s quite challenging, with the whole route being 19km, however it is well worth it. For the longer treks such as the \u201ctowers\u201d walk, a reasonable level of fitness is required and passengers must be prepared for all weather conditions. We recommend packing trekking boots, waterproof trousers and a positive outlook to all weather!Come evening, relax in one of the most peaceful places on earth as you enjoy time with your group and fellow travellers in the camps. Play card games, share stories and learn more about Patagonia from the various guides on hand.Please Note: The schedule for today and tomorrow is interchangeable depending on the weather conditions. Our local mountain guides will decide on the best hikes/excursions for your group each day.Enjoy another full day in this majestic landscape. Your tour leader and local guides will be on hand to assist with recommendations depending on the weather.If you feel you need to give your legs a rest, go horse riding through the valleys for some of the most picturesque views from horseback.Note: From 1st November to 31st March there are additional hikes that can be done by crossing Lago Pehoe in a Catamaran. The cost for the crossing is CLP 35,000 each way.Next up is the enchanting city of El Calafate, full of Patagonian charm and surrounded by snow-capped mountains. Resting on the Argentinian side of Patagonia, the town was founded in 1927 and originally used to shelter the local wool traders. Over time, with the popularity of the nearby National Parks growing, the town has flourished and welcomes many visitors each year.Named after the local berry calafate, it is rumoured that those who eat the berry will at some point always return to Patagonia.Tomorrow is a packed day visiting the Perito Moreno Glacier, so make the most of the local artisans market, the little cafes, excellent ice-cream shops and if you like your meat, the lamb found in El Calafate is particularly delicious.Today we experience the jaw dropping Perito Moreno Glacier and surrounding park. The spectacular ice formation is around 30 kilometres in length and fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the third largest reserve of freshwater in the world. While many glaciers worldwide are currently decreasing in size, the Perito Moreno glacier is gaining just as much ice as it looses so retains its impressive size and formation.Named after Argentine explorer Francisco Merino, the glacier is coloured in a variety of hues from blue to grey to white and continually creaks and cracks. Advancing at a speed of around two metres per day, it can put on a spectacular show when giant chunks of ice at the outermost edges crack under tremendous pressure, rupture and crash into the water \u2013 a process known as calving. You will have the chance to walk around some paths and terraces where you can get some great views of the glacier.Today we will travel to El Chalten, a village located within Los Glaciares National Park and the starting point of many beautiful walking trails. While on the truck enjoy some of the best views as you journey through the wilderness, stopping at Mount Fitz Roy for some spectacular photo opportunities. This grand mountain stands on the border between Chile and Argentina, with a large part close to the summit remaining undefined as to which country it belongs to.Arriving in El Chalten, you will feel immersed in the unspoiled nature that surrounds you. Founded in 1985, the small town has fantastic views of the mountains that shadow over it, and was even named Argentina\u2019s Trekking Capital.Spend the rest of the evening enjoying the town and dine in one of the many quaint restaurants. For such a small place there is a surprising amount on offer from local delicacies to other foods from all over Argentina.Hop on private transportation today to make the journey through the natural beauty of Los Glacieres National Park. Our local expert guide for the day will meet us at our hotel and get us ready for today\u2019s hike, an alternative to the traditional hike to the Fitz Roy viewpoint. Our exploration of the natural beauty of Los Glaciares National Park starts with a 40-minute transfer to El Pilar, heading north out of El Chalten, via the road leading to Lago del Desierto (Desert Lake).Form here we start trekking along the Rio Blanco gently ascending from 500m to 800m altitude until we arrive at the Poincenot camp. On the way we will pass the Piedras Blancas Glacier viewpoint and the Piedras Blancas Lagoon as well as the Valley del Marconi and the entrance to the southern ice field. With our legs warmed up nicely, we start a steep 1km climb of rocky steps with little vegetation around to protect us from the Patagonian wind. While physically demanding, the views that receive us at the top are some of the most impressive in Patagonia. From here, on a clear day, we can see the entire Fitz Roy Massif, the Laguna de los Tres, Glacier de los Tres as well as both Laguna Sucia and Glacier Sucio, a spectacular sight. After a quick lunch, weather permitting, we begin the hour descent to Rio Blanco again before joining the traditional route straight down to El Chalten.If you do not wish to do the Laguna de los Tres hike there are various other options available from El Chalten.Saying goodbye to the wilderness, today we head for Buenos Aires.Known as the \u201cParis of South America\u201d due its lovely green parks and wide boulevards, Argentina\u2019s capital is the perfect destination for culture lovers. The Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes boasts an impressive collection including original pieces by Monet, Renoir and C\u00e9zanne. Another highlight for art buffs is the MALBA, otherwise known as the contemporary art museum. The museum features work from iconic Latino artists such as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, as well as many local and smaller artists.Try your luck at finding the city\u2019s best alfajores, a thick layer of dulce de leche sandwiched between two biscuits. One of the most popular sweet treats in the country, you will see these being sold everywhere from street kiosks to cute cafes.With 4 days in this vibrant and lively city, don\u2019t worry about packing it all in at once!Today is free to further explore Buenos Aires. Wander around the variety of craft markets, where you may come across live bands, barbecues, make-shift bars and practising tango dancers for a truly atmospheric Latin-American experience. San Telmo is the best market for antiques, while the market at Recoleta has great hand-made crafts. No visit to Buenos Aires would be complete without a stroll around the upmarket boutiques and caf\u00e9s of the Palermo district, and the contrasting bohemian barrio of La Boca, where inhabitants of the area used left-over paint from the nearby shipyards to paint their humble houses made of scrap metal in bright, block colours.The city is also world-renowned for its incredible nightlife, with many nightclubs, bars, restaurants and cinemas open all night. For a great evening, you could see an authentic tango show in the city where the dance originated, and you can\u2019t leave Buenos Aires without trying some of the best steaks in the world!Perhaps start your day sampling some of the best coffee in the city, as Bueno Aires is known for its expanding caf\u00e9 culture. Known as bares notables, these traditional cafes are an important part of the city\u2019 heritage and meeting a friend for a coffee is seen as an everyday activity.

Unlike most other waterfalls that have just one or two cataracts, at Iguaz\u00fa Falls there are 275 cataracts in a magnificent 3 kilometre long U shape that we will visit from both sides.Visiting the Argentine side of the falls you can board a speed boat which will take you under the falls soaking you from head to toe, an (optional) adventure you'll never forget! On the Argentine side you'll also find the famous \"Devil's Throat\" where fourteen falls drop with such force that there is always a massive cloud of spray overhead. Following this we transfer to Brazil.Visiting the Brazilian side of the falls will give you a completely different perspective from the Argentine side. On the Brazilian side you can see the falls by walking through the rainforest and along catwalks above and below the rushing water. You can also visit the world's largest hydroelectric dam at Itaipu (optional) where you can learn more about the ecological issues faced during the dam's construction. There is also a very interesting bird park nearby, perfect for that must-have photo with a toucan!Today we fly to Rio de Janeiro.This huge seaside city is famed for its nightlife and golden beaches, with plenty to see and do for travellers.

You can walk from the top of the staircase up to the quiet hill-top neighbourhood of Santa Teresa, with many quaint caf\u00e9s and shops lining the cobblestone streets. In the city centre, you can stroll around Rio's old colonial buildings and wander around the skyscrapers of the financial district.Today is free for you to get under the skin of Rio.
