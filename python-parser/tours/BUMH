Myanmar today has only recently opened its border to travellers after the Military Junta, in control since 1962 was dissolved after years of internal struggle as recently as 2011. As this largely rural country remains unaffected by long term tourism it offers us a wonderful insight into Southeast Asian life.</p><p>Why not visit the Mahamuni Pagoda with its old Buddha statue. Typically a lively temple, men put gold leaves into the statue. Here you can also shop around for the perfect souvenir, your own small statue made of bronze or wood. If you can't find what you are looking for, the marble carving street should have a treat in store. Walking through the Mahagandayon monastery complex, see hundreds of monks heading to prayers.</p><p>Tonight, you can visit the Yadanar night market to get a feel for the real Mandalay. Grab some traditional snacks before enjoying a beer at a famous beer station and a delicious meal at one of Mandalay's traditional BBQ restaurants.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Oway Grand Hotel or similar .

They poke out of the trees and have a graceful aging process. It is here that the sunsets are some of the best in the world.</p><p>On arrival, we enjoy a half day guided orientation tour of the area where you will see some of the best temples in the region. Discover Ananda, Sulamani, and Thatbyinnyu, the latter being one of the highest monuments in Bagan.</p><p>The best way to see the many hundreds of temples in the area of Bagan is by bicycle and the day after arriving in Bagan, we take a guided tour of the site by bicycle The flat landscape makes a bike tour an easy excursion and your guide will show you some of the most spectacular ancient temples away from the crowds. Cycle through the palm trees and bamboo huts finding temples along the way.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Staying at Hotel Umbra or similar .

A community project only recently established here, protects the jungle, the wildlife that resides in it and the traditions of the local people living in the area. The project also protects some of Myanmar’s endangered elephants which, without this protection, may have been hunted down and killed or sold into the tourism trade.</p><p>These elephants are ‘retired’ from working life and we will have the opportunity to wash and feed the elephants but riding them is strictly not allowed. Returning to the camp, we will enjoy lunch before continuing our journey to Kalaw. Travelling by private vehicle, we might make multiple stops on the way to Kalaw in local villages. We may learn how to make toddy and jaggery (palm sugar) from the sap of the toddy palm.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

This scenic journey travels over the Shan mountains and through the valleys towards Inle Lake. A unique local experience that offers great views and a glimpse of local life in the Shan mountains en route. The train has been used by locals and westerners alike for over 100 years and has a distinctive colonial feel to it. This train can't be prebooked so you may be seated in the "ordinary class" giving you a real taste of how locals travel by train. An interesting and sustainable way to travel!</p><p>Arriving at Shwe Nyaung a transfer will take us to our hotel. The following day, we spend a full day on the lake, travelling by boat between traditional villages built on stilts and inhabited by the Intha people. We visit floating gardens, pass some of the fishermen who row their boats using their legs, balancing precariously on the other. One of the main highlights of the excursion is the lunch made by a local family. You will experience authentic Intha food including the famous tomato salad, meat cakes steamed in banana leaves and more. You will also visit traditional markets in different villages depending on the day we travel. If time allows, we will also visit a cheroot factory where Burmese cigars are made, floating tomato gardens, Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda and Intha Heritage House where Burmese cats are bred.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Maine Li or similar .

Despite being a city, here it is common to see locals walking down the street barefoot with natural sunblock from the Thanaka tree rubbed on their faces. There is plenty to do in this bustling city from food tours, local markets, lakes and pagodas.</p><p>The largest and most beautiful pagoda is the Shwedagon Pagoda and it is the most religion site in Myanmar. It was originally built in the 6th century AD and has been rebuilt and developed over time to become the sprawling, golden site of today. It is also a meeting point for locals. Children play, monks chat and women gossip while it is possible to pick up some souvenirs from the shops outside the site.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Clover City Centre Hotel or similar .

<p>Oway Grand Hotel<br />No. 624, 78th Street (between 30th &amp;amp; 31st Street)<br />Central Mandalay<br />Mandalay</p>
<p>Tel: + 95 9 421171181, 91014161, 02-72395</p>
<p>This hotel has wi-fi and a laundry service.</p>
<p>There are safe deposit boxes for your use. Please leave all of your important documents here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you.It is not advisable to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Mandalay</h5>
<p>The airport has both ATMs and money exchange services. If you have booked a transfer on arrival, a driver will be waiting for you at the arrival gate, holding a Tucan Travel sign.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>To get from Mandalay airport to the joining hotel, you can find a Taxi Counter in the arrivals terminal, where you can buy a coupon for the taxi - there is a set price for each destination so there are so scams. Outside the airport, there will be a line of taxis. You just need to give the coupon to the taxi driver.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a variety of hotels. You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. If you wish to book a double bed, please advice your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>
<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on most occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans. The mode of transport is chosen based on schedule and timings, comfort, group size, location and reliability.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport.</p>

Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cooler depending on the season you are travelling, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus a thinner sweater which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, Southeast Asia is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong for this. When packing, please consider that any included flights on your tour have a luggage weight restriction of 20kg.</p>

<h5>Laundry</h5>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p>
<h5>E-Cigarettes</h5>
<p>Please be aware that many countries in Southeast Asia have banned the use of e-cigarettes and it is not possible to bring them into the country with you. Please check regulations before you depart.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the Burmese kyat.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. In general, Southeast Asia is a cheap destination.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of Southeast Asian culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p>
</description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<h5>Breakfast on tour</h5>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box with a few simple pieces to keep you going. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a local breakfast.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance before meeting your tour please call (+66) 633 21 0066.</p>
<h5>Safety in Myanmar</h5>
<p>Myanmar is generally safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera, Diphtheria and influenza. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling. It is also a good idea to be vaccinated against rabies if you will be coming into contact with animals.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
