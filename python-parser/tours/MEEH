Originally founded in 2,000 BC and known to be one of the largest cities in Africa, Cairo has established itself as a city of significant landmarks that began to emerge as a result of Roman rule in 30 BC. Journey via private vehicle deep into Arab culture and prepare to explore a city and country bursting with ancient history, grandeur and a fascinating way of living.</p><p>Today is an arrival day and no activities are planned, however if you are arriving with enough time we recommend exploring the Cave Church in Cairo, which is one of the largest churches in the country as well as paying a visit to the Coptic Museum which is home to the largest collection of Egyptian Christian artifacts in the world. Note that you will be transferred from the airport to your joining hotel where there will be a pre-departure meeting held at approximately 6:00pm.</p><p>If you have booked pre-tour accommodation through Tucan Travel then your arrival airport transfer will be included on the day you arrive in Cairo.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Zayed Hotel or similar .

Crossing the River Nile, we head to Giza where we visit the famous  Pyramids and Sphinx. Here you will have some free time to explore these magnificent wonders.</p><p>Considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, Egypt’s majestic Pyramids were built to honour dead Pharaohs. The three great pyramids that are part of The Giza plateau date back from a period of construction between 3,800 and 2,800 BC and are located on the West bank of the River Nile because of the symbolism associating with the realm of the dead when the sun sets there in the evenings.</p><p>After an exciting day of exploring these great ancient monuments you will head to the train station to board your overnight sleeper train to Aswan. Dinner will be included on the overnight train journey.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on overnight sleeper trains .

Most notably, you will visit the Temple of Isis (in honour of the goddess). This classic Egyptian temple lies in between two dams at Aswan and can only be reached by boat.</p><p>After visiting Philae Temple you will have the opportunity to visit the Aswan High Dam, an impressive engineering masterpiece which stands at an a whopping 364ft.</p><p>If you would like to get a taste for the local flavour and culture then you have the opportunity to visit a local Nubian village and enjoy dinner and a show in one of the Nubian houses.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Cleopatra Hotel or similar .

These temples are considered masterpieces of Ancient Egypt that were built for King Ramses II and Queen Nefertari both also reflecting the glory and grandeur of the new Kingdom. Both temples were discovered in 1813, after centuries of being buried under desert sands, but were then relocated in 1960 with the help of the Egyptian government and UNESCO to avoid the rising water of the Nile. A site not to be missed!</p><p>Alternatively you can spend the morning relaxing before boarding your traditional felucca boat to embark on an unforgettable sailing adventure down the River Nile. You will depart from Aswan early afternoon, making your way to Kom Ombo. Lunch and dinner will be served on the felucca.</p><p> Please note:  You will be required to bring your own sleeping bag for the felucca sailing experience.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on a traditional felucca sailing boat (Sleeping bag required)  .

Overlooking the Nile, the Kom Ombo temple was built in dedication to the gods of Sobek (the Crocodile God) and Haroeris (the Falcon God), and has since become a popular part of Egyptian history that is visited by many for its grand inner halls and intricate wall carvings.</p><p>After exploring Kom Ombo you continue to follow the River Nile by road. The next stop for today will be Edfu Temple. The Edfu temple contains both elements of Greek and New Kingdom temples. Here you will also get the chance to walk through the 37m high temple and explore its court and inner chapel.</p><p>The adventure continues in the afternoon as you travel to Luxor, where you will have the next couple of days to explore the city and its surrounding attractions. The Luxor area is filled with more magnificent temples and valleys; you will find yourself at the very heart of ancient Egypt when visiting Luxor.</p><p>We have included some important excursions in Luxor but not all as there is just so much to see and do and we want you to have the flexibility to see the things on your bucket list!</p><p>A popular choice in the evening is to visit Karnak Temple for the ‘Light and Sound’ show. The light and sound show in the evening showcases the greatest achievements of some of the great Pharaohs as they come to life with accompanying music and light effects that you can experience as you wander through the complex.</p><p>Please note: There are many optional excursions available in Luxor. It may not be possible to do all of them, however your Tour Leader will try to arrange them for you according to the best suitable times.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Lotus Hotel or similar .

This morning you will have an included excursion to Valley of the Kings. The valley holds over 60 tombs that were once surrounded by a plethora of Egyptian treasures, the most notable being the final resting ground for King Tutankhamun which visitors can see. Admission to the Valley of the Kings complex is included, but entrance to the actual tombs will be at an additional cost if you dare to enter!</p><p>After visiting the Valley of the Kings our next stop will be Colossi of Memnon. These gigantic statues have survived for 3,400 years in the hot desert sun and are visited by many despite the condition of the statues being affected by weather conditions.</p><p>This afternoon you will have time to explore some of the many options available in the Luxor area. Your tour leader will be on hand to assist you in arranging these excursions. Maybe you would prefer to take a little relaxation time or perhaps soak up the atmosphere at the Luxor bazaar (Souk)? A visit to the souk is a real insight into local life, you will see traders selling local produce, household utensils, tools and other goods as well as  jewellery, bags, leather goods, souvenirs, spices, scarves and all sorts of other trinkets and treasures.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Lotus Hotel or similar .

If you have a head for heights why not opt for the scenic hot air balloon journey over the ancient and historical sites of Luxor? This excursion can be arranged locally and is subject to availability. Please note that the operation of this excursion is weather dependant.</p><p>If you have not already visited then this is also a good time to visit the Karnak temple which is known to be one of the world’s greatest ancient sites. The temple itself contains two museums - the Mummification museum where you can learn more about the ancient process of mummification and the Luxor museum displaying a small but impressive collection of ancient Egyptian artefacts.</p><p>Alternatively it is also worth opting to visit the ancient temple of Hatshepsut which differs to others due to its classical style of architecture. After a busy morning of exploration we depart Luxor as we hop on an overnight train returning to Cairo.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on overnight sleeper trains .

After checking into our hotel, we head back out to visit the Egyptian Museum. Here is where you will come face-to-face with more ancient treasures and if you are lucky you will get to view the infamous Gold Death Mask of Tutankhamun.</p><p>Our day of culture continues as we make our way towards Cairo’s oldest church, also known as The Hanging Church and the nearby Ben Ezra Synagogue. We also stop at the 19th Century Mosque of Muhammad Ali (also known as Saladin Citadel) to admire grand structure and take in some great views of Cairo.</p><p>Time dependant, you may also have some free time to explore Cairo a little more this afternoon. Tonight will be your last night on tour and you will be free to enjoy this as you wish, however our Tour Leader will be happy to arrange a final group dinner for everyone who wishes to join.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Zayed Hotel or similar .

<h5>Ramadan</h5>
<p>In 2020, Ramadan will fall between the 23rd April and 23rd May. Ramadan is a month long period of fasting observed by Muslims where they should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. Generally, our tours will operate as normal during this period although there may be some limitations to services in certain areas. Food is still available to non-Muslims however you should display a higher level of cultural sensitivity and try to refrain from eating, drinking or smoking in public during this time out of respect for those who cannot. In addition to this you should also ensure that your clothing covers knees and shoulders. If you have further questions about what to expect please contact an Adventure Specialist.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour includes a variety of accommodation that is chosen based on comfort, cleanliness and location.

<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on most occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance. A private room is unavailable on the felucca sailing boat.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>

<p>This tour uses the Egyptian Pound.</p>
<h5>Tipping Kitty</h5>
<p>Tipping is part of the culture in Egypt, so we have included the cost of most of the tipping on this tour. This will include the tip for any included meals, excursions, transport and accommodation staff. Please note that should you take part in optional excursions that are separate from the tour, the tip will not be included. The tipping kitty also does not include a tip for your tour leader at the end of the tour. If you feel that your tour leader has provided excellent service, a discretionary tip is always appreciated.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Egypt will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><h5>Luggage</h5>
<p>You will be carrying your own luggage on tour. Please limit this to one piece per person plus one day bag.</p>

<h5>Packing List</h5>

Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost unless stated as included in the literary. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the Middle East, there is a huge choice of incredible food.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><p>The Middle East is generally safe, even more so in a group tour. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
