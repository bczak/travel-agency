Today roughly fifty Ecuadorians inhabit the island. Punta Cormorant offers two highly contrasting beaches; the strand where the yacht anchors is composed of volcanic olivine crystals, giving it a greenish tint that glitters in the sun. From here a trail crosses the neck of the isthmus - which rises to form a cinder cone - to a beach of very fine white sand, formed by the erosion of coral skeletons. Between the two beaches is a salt lagoon frequented by flamingos, pintails, stilts and other wading birds.</p><p>After breakfast, the dinghy will take you to the rocky crevice of Devil's Crown where you have the opportunity to do some deep-water snorkelling off Floreana Island. Later you will make a wet landing at the beach of Cormorant Point. Hike along the sandy beach and keep your eyes out for the American Flamingo lagoon.</p><p>This afternoon you will visit Post Office Bay and Baroness Lookout where you can admire the spectacular views. Post Office Bay has a working post office, so make sure you bring your postcards to send your friends and family back home!
