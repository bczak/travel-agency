Old Havana is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was once unquestionably one of the most beautiful places in the world. There are numerous monuments dating back to the colonial times, such as el Morro Castle, el Templete, Colon Cemetrey, the Church and Convent of St. Francisco de Assisi and the Palace of the Capitanes Generales. However, there is much more to Havana than its colonial past. It is the only city in the world where you will find vintage American cars used as taxis, ration shops juxtaposed against gleaming colonial palaces and salsa and rumba enthusiastically practiced in the streets under revolutionary slogans.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

You will begin the tour with a drive in a classic American car before exploring on foot. You will travel along the Malecón Esplanade, stopping at the Capitol building area. During the drive you will enjoy panoramic views of the Revolution Museum, The Fine Arts Museum, the Parque Central and the Gran Teatro de la Habana. You will stop at the Revolutionary Square to see the portrait of Ché Guevara and stop for photos at the José Martí monument, the National Library and Revolution Place.</p><p>It is then time to discover Old Havana on foot as you continue through the alleys and squares of the historic city centre. With your guide you will take in the most important sights such as Plaza de Armas, the Castillo de la Real Fuerza, the Templete, the Palacio del Segundo Cabo and more. Stroll around Obispo Street to see the Ambos Mundos Hotel, Havana’s first university - San Geronimo de la Habana, the Plaza de la Cathedral and La Bodeguita del Medio where you can reward yourself with a legendary mojito at the bar often frequented by Gabriel Garcia Marques, Pablo Neruda and most famously, Hemingway.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

You will be collected from your hotel for the journey to Viñales, a small, rural town in the middle of the beautiful countryside, in the Pinar del Rio province. Cuba is famous for its production of cigars and Viñales is famous within this industry for producing the best quality tobacco. The landscape here was once covered by limestone but much of this has eroded away, leaving mountains with steep sides and rounded, tree covered tops. The mountains are called mogotes (haystacks) due to their distinctive shape.</p><p>You can discuss with your driver the places you would like to visit today. For instance, you could see a mural commissioned by Fidel Castro in 1961. The cliff has been painted with snails, dinosaurs and a family of cave people, in garish colours and whilst hardly authentic, it is certainly interesting. At the Cueva del Indio you can sail in a small dinghy on an underground river through a cave. Minerals deposited on the roofs and walls of the caves have turned the surfaces milky green, rendering the scenery all the more mysterious.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Las Terrazas is part of an ambitious reforestation project dating back to 1968 which was a set up by the Cuban government and UNESCO, in order to restore the ecological balance of the region which was effected by centuries of coffee plantations. Las Terrazas has lovely natural scenery and is a great place for hiking and bird watching as there are over 100 different species found here.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

En route you will visit the Bay of Pigs, where Americans once tried to invade Cuba. They did not succeed as Fidel Castro led the Cuban army to victory. There is a lot of history in Cienfuegos, reflected in the racial mix and architecture of the Pearl of the South. You will see broad neoclassical boulevards and art deco façades and this architectural style is due to the many French colonists who settled in Cienfuegos after they fled Haiti during its independence war. There is also a strong Afro-Caribbean presence here.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Trinidad is known as Cuba’s Museum City as for a small town, it has an impressive collection of museums. All are set in fine examples of colonial architecture within the UNESCO-listed old quarter. Of particular interest is the Museo Romantica, crammed with antiques, the stunning Museo Historico de Trinidad and for a background to the Communist Revolution, the Museo de la Lucha Contra Bandidos.
