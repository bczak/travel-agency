We begin our tour in Bogot&amp;#225;, the capital and largest city of Colombia. Colonial buildings give way to modern skyscrapers, the Andean peaks sit tranquilly in the backdrop and the many parks provide sanctuary from the hustle and bustle. You are free to arrive today at your leisure and start enjoying this wonderful city. There will be a pre departure meeting tonight to meet your tour leader and fellow travellers.</p><p>We will be staying in the Candelaria district, an excellent location within walking distance of many of the main sights including the main square - Plaza Bol&amp;#237;var, the Cathedral and Sim&amp;#243;n Bol&amp;#237;var's house. You may like to take the funicular to Monserrate for the incredible city views, or visit the world famous gold museum. A recommended activity would be the graffiti tour where you can explore some of the famous street art that adorns the city&amp;#39;s walls. Another highlight is visiting the Botero Museum to see some of the artist&amp;#39;s work depicting people and objects in large formats.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Monserrat or similar .

It is often a place of pilgrimage and on Sundays can attract 3000 people to worship. After exploring this unique church we will continue our journey, driving to the quaint town, Villa de Leyva.</p><p>This attractive town was founded in 1572 and has been preserved well, with virtually no modern architectural influences at all, as a National Monument by the Colombian Government. You'll have time to enjoy its charming colonial plaza, exploring the narrow streets and private courtyards. Get talking to some of the locals, Colombians are some of the friendliest people in South America and are always happy to show you their way of life.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Sol de la Villa or similar .

You could opt to book a day tour which visits various locations that surround Villa de Leyva including the unique dinosaur fossil museum. The countryside here is famous for its fossil discoveries and the museum houses many bones which have been collected over the years. You can also visit the fascinating Terracotta House which wouldn&amp;#39;t look out of place in The Flintstones. The house is made entirely of red clay and makes for some really unique photos!</p><p>You can also take hikes or biking tours around the area to admire the countryside.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Sol de la Villa or similar .

From here we will drive to Villavieja, a small town which is the gateway for visiting the Tatacoa Desert. Actually a tropical dry forest, the Tatacoa is the second largest arid area in Colombia and is a popular attraction for those wanting to experience its surreal rock formations and unique landscape. Red hues stretch out as far as the eye can see and it's hard to believe this region was once a lush forest overflowing with vegetation!</p><p>We visit the desert where you will have time to capture some great photos and learn more about the area. We will then return to our accommodation in Villavieja for the evening. Villavieja itself is a lovely authentic Colombian town which offers unparalleled tranquillity and a unique insight into this lesser known area of Colombia.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Boutique Yararaka or similar .

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, little is known about the communities that carved these statues apart from the few traces of their existence that they left behind. Arriving in the late afternoon, you will have the remainder of the day to relax.</p><p>When you are not exploring the archaeological site, you can enjoy the stunning green landscape, hike through the hills or take a jeep tour.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anacaona or similar .

There are hundreds of these statues to see spread over a huge area as well as many ancient burial sites. The pre-Columbian community was eventually replaced by a new group of people who arrived possibly from the Amazon region in the late eighth century bringing in more complex agriculture practises. The parks also have some amazing views of the valley.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anacaona or similar .

Admire La Ermita, a church famous for its Gothic style architecture before soaking up the lively atmosphere in the Barrio de San Antonio area. Here you can get great views of the city from the top of the hill as well as having a host of restaurants and bars. Cali also has the perfect climate for growing all sorts of fruits and you will find vendors selling everything from green mango to mora (a cross between a raspberry and blackberry) with plenty more exotic fruits on offer. Or why not try the local delicacy of pandebono, a cheesy bread sold in bakeries and cafes throughout the city.</p><p>On our journey to Cali, we will pass the Parque Nacional de Puracé, a beautiful national park which features the active Puracé – one of Colombia's only active volcanoes. The unique ecosystem here is also home to frailejones, a member of the sunflower family that produces more than 10 litres of water per day. These magnificent plants capture water vapor from the clouds above and release it through their roots.</p><p>We will arrive into Cali in the evening, just in time to follow the infectious sounds of the city and join in with a nightclub salsa dance as the locals shimmy the night away. If dancing is not your thing, you can still experience the atmosphere by watching a local show!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Puerta de San Antonio or similar .

Why not take a guided city tour to learn about the history and culture of this spirited corner of the world, or if you prefer to learn about a destination through your taste buds you could book onto a foodie tour and learn the secrets behind some of the most popular Colombian cuisine.</p><p>If you would like a more tranquil activity you could visit Andoke, a huge butterfly farm located just outside of the city. It is home to 15 different species with a series of walkways connecting the different parts. A staff nember will explain everything about the flora and fauna of the garden and you could even see all stages - from cocoons to caterpillars!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Puerta de San Antonio or similar .

After our flight we arrive in the early afternoon with plenty of time to explore these ancient wonders.</p><p>Taironaka is a relatively unknown area in northern Colombia and the perfect place to get off the beaten track. Located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the stunning nature reserve is home to a lush and tropical landscape that echos Colombian beauty.</p><p>Taironaka was home to the ancient Tayrona civilisation and the ruins remain to this day, with small buildings arranged around terraced stone circles showing the social hierarchy at the time. The reserve is reached by a short boat trip heading up the Don Diego river, another perfect opportunity to experience the tranquility of the rainforest. If you’re still spinning from the rhythm of Cali, take this opportunity to relax in one of the many hammocks on the grounds with your favourite book.</p><p>Come evening enjoy an included group meal, choose from various typical dishes from the region. Kick back to the sounds of nature and enjoy your peaceful night as we stay in the heart of the rainforest in the quaint Ecohotel. Inspired by the indigenous constructions with their thatched roofs and rustic architecture, we guarantee the authentic charm of the place will draw you in.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a jungle eco-lodge at Ecohotel or similar .

It is a few hours of moderate hiking to reach the secluded beaches where roads and cars have no access. The guided walk will take us through the dense rainforest, stumbling across its many residents from the animal and bug kingdom. You can snorkel in the reefs with magnificent tropical fish and marine life or enjoy fresh food from the local food stalls. Tayrona National Park is a chance to recharge your batteries. To enter Tayrona National Park it is suggested you have a valid yellow fever certificate, however this is not necessary.</p><p>After a day in the park we arrive at the oldest city in Colombia and the first one settled by the Spanish, Santa Marta. The city has an important historical centre and a beautiful old town, and is a popular destination for Colombian tourists.</p><p>IMPORTANT:  In 2020 between the dates of 1st and 29th February, 1st and 15th June, and 19th October and 2nd November , Tayrona National Park will be closed while the indigenous communities are given the time to clean the park and perform traditional rituals within its parameters. If you are travelling while the park is closed you will have a different but equally exciting tour inside Taironaka Nature Reserve where you will be escorted by a local guide for a short walk through the lush rainforest, and will then have the relaxing experience of tubing down the Dondieguito river while taking in the local flora and fauna. The river is shallow and very calm so it is not necessary to be an advanced swimmer to enjoy this unique experience.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Park Hotel or similar .

Due to its coastal location Santa Marta was the first Spanish settlement in Colombia.</p><p>You could opt to book a day trip visiting Minca, where you can get up close and personal with nature. Think organic coffee farms, breath-taking waterfalls and exciting jungle hikes. Part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, the trip offers various activities that give you another taste of the beautiful Colombian countryside.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Park Hotel or similar .

Founded in 1533, it was strategically placed so that it could act as the main port for trade between Spain and the Spanish Empire.</p><p>You have time to wander the fascinating narrow streets adorned with wooden balconies and hanging plants. There are several interesting sites to see such as a visit to Castillo San Felipe and the fortress on San Lazaro hill. Beneath this fortress is a maze of tunnels and there are still cannons in place along the battlements.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Casa Mara or similar .

Worthwhile is a trip up La Popa hill to visit the colourful convent with great views over the city.</p><p>The Boca Grande area of Cartagena is where Colombians come for their beach holidays and it is full of shops, nightclubs and bars. Near Cartagena is the Volc&amp;#225;n de Lodo El Totumo, a mud volcano where you can relax and wallow in the mud, which is believed to be a good treatment for the skin.</p><p>You could also visit the Rosario Islands, located around one hour from Cartagena. Picture crystal blue waters, lush greenery, straw beach huts and delicious fresh seafood. These islands are essentially a Caribbean paradise - all accessible on a short day trip from Cartagena!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Casa Mara or similar .

your tour in Bogota</name><description><p>Your joining location is listed below but can be subject to change. Please check your voucher before you travel.</p>
<p>Hotel Monserrat<br /> Carrera 3 12f-28 La Candelaria<br /> Bogota</p>
<p>Tel: (+57) (1) 281 1801</p>
<p>The hotels should have safe deposit boxes for your use (you will get an itemised receipt). Remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you. It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major South American cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry day-packs on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Bogota</h5>
<p>We recommend obtaining Colombian peso as soon as you arrive. Some ATMs in Colombia allow as little as COP300.000 ($150) per withdrawal, so you may need to make more than one withdrawal or find another machine if you wish to withdraw more than that. There are money exchange facilities and ATMs located throughout the airport.</p>
<p>The hotels are located in the Candelaria neighbourhood which is the Old City of Bogota. This district has pastel-painted Spanish colonial houses, cobbled streets, a lively scene including buskers and street art, and the National Gold Museum, the Botero Museum are both walking distance from here. Walking around La Candelaria at night on your own is not recommended.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<p>Making your own way If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel, you will find taxis waiting at at the airport. Official taxis are yellow; they are often small and some only allow two passengers per vehicle. A taxi from the airport to La Candelaria should cost approximately COP20.000. You should never go with an unlicensed driver.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a great variety of accommodation, providing you with unique experiences to last a lifetime!

<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>

In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans.

Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, South America is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong to cover up for this.</p>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the Colombian peso.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of South American culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of Asian cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p>
<p>Overall the food scene in South America is incredible and you will get to experience everything from local lunches in rural areas to high end restaurants in the bigger cities. The markets in Cusco and the Central Market in Santiago are especially good to pick up some local treats. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>South America has some amazing markets selling delicious food. Eating at local markets is a great way to experience authentic food and at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in South America</h5>
<p>South America is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Altitude Sickness</h5>
<p>All clients warrant and accept that there is a chance they may get some form of altitude sickness on itineraries that generally travel to altitudes over 2,400 metres though Tucan Travel will not expose clients to any undue risk of altitude sickness. Tucan Travel tour leaders, staff and local suppliers working at higher altitudes will have some level of knowledge and / or training on how to help and advise you. Please read the information contained <a href="high-altitude-sickness">here</a> to ensure you understand the risks and what to do in this event.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
