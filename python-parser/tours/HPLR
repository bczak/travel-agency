Your adventure starts here in Lima and you are free to arrive today at your leisure.</p><p>Lima was founded by the Spanish Conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 1535 after he eradicated the Incas and made the city his capital. The city has many beautiful colonial buildings and some of the best museums in South America including the Gold Museum, Museum of the Inquisition and the Catacombs below the San Francisco Church.</p><p>Peru's capital has much to offer and many of the sights, including the city's two main squares the Plaza de Armas and Plaza San Martin, boast some fantastic sightseeing opportunities. The Plaza de Armas houses the Cathedral, Municipal Palace and Presidential Palace where the changing of the guard can be seen every day at 12 noon.</p><p>Another highlight of Lima is the Huaca Pucllana, ruins of a pre-Incan pyramid. The clay structure, built in seven staggered levels is one of the few that remain from the historic pre-Colombian period in Peru. It is thought to have been built around 500 AD and would have been used for spiritual ceremonies. Located in the Miraflores district, it's surprisingly very easy to get it!</p><p>Of course you should also spend time sampling some delicious local Peruvian food.

Covering nearly two thirds of the country, the area is home to around 600 species of birds, 1200 types of butterflies and 300 reptiles, to name a few. As eco-tourism continues to grow, there are a number of eco lodges allowing you to experience the rainforest in the most responsible and authentic way possible.</p><p>We will transfer to the airport for our flight to the jungle community of Puerto Maldonado, the starting point for our visit to the Amazon rainforest. Here you can pick up last minute drinks and snacks before the group continue with a short bus ride followed by riverboat journey to reach the accommodation for the night. Sailing along the river, the trip takes around 2 hours and is an excellent chance to relax and start to take in the magic of the rainforest.</p><p>Arriving at your riverside lodge, check in and have some time to relax before an afternoon of exploring. After lunch we will set off on a trek through the rainforest along wooden walkways. On the way our guide will stop to show you various species of bird and explain the medicinal plants and delicate ecological systems of the Amazon Jungle. The scenery is extremely varied incorporating dense jungle as well as marsh areas. You will see incredibly big trees, several metres in diameter and around 450 years old. We walk to Cochita Caiman (Caiman Pond) where we see wildlife along the way. We then return to the lodge for dinner.</p><p>Please note: The eco-lodges in the Amazon jungle are designed to give travellers the most authentic jungle experience while limiting disruption to the animals and plantlife. The bungalows are built from local indigenous materials with the rooms sealed by mesh netting to keep mosquitoes out. All rooms have private bathroom facilities however these are basic and hot water can be limited. There is portable water available at the lodge therefore we recommend taking a reusable water bottle with you. Electricity is limited and it is advisable to bring portable chargers for your electronics and ensure they are fully charged. After dark, the walkways are lit by oil lamps. The lodges include a welcome area, dining room and bar, meaning there are plenty areas for your group to relax and socialise. Single supplements are not available in the bungalows. If you have further questions on what to expect, your tour leader will be happy to assist. All excursions in the jungle are led by an English speaking guide.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a jungle lodge at Eco Amazonia Lodge or similar .

We may also catch a glimpse of the rare giant otter. Afterwards we will enjoy the view of the lake from our viewing point/observation platform, where you can experience the canopy wildlife such as parrots, guacamayos, toucans, camungos, shanshos, herons, turtles and caiman. We will return to the lodge for a well deserved lunch.</p><p>After a break and some yummy food, we take a short boat trip across the Madre de Dios River to Monkey Island. On the way over you may spot caiman from the boat. Once on the island it is possible to see a great variety of monkeys such as the ‘maquisapa’, black and white ‘Martins’, ‘Leoncito de la Selva’ (Little Lions), ‘Frailes’ (Friars), ‘Achuñis’, ‘Ronsocos’ as well as an array of birdlife. In the evenings it is often possible to enjoy the wonderful sunset, one of the most impressive sights of the forest (weather permitting).</p><p>Enjoy your final night in the heart of the jungle soaking up this magical and peaceful atmosphere.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a jungle lodge at Eco Amazonia Lodge or similar .

Visit the Cathedral, which was built with blocks from the nearby Inca site of Sacsaywamán and took almost a century to complete.</p><p>Spend the evening relaxing and acclimatising to the altitude, maybe picking up a bag of coca leaves to make some tea, the locals swear by this!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anden Inca or similar .

At an altitude of 3800m we take slow walks that take up to an hour, around each of the ruins in order to manage any effects the high altitude may have. Firstly we visit the Pisac ruins, perched on a hilltop with incredible views of the surrounding mountains. We then go down to the famous traditional market of the same name, which is full of colour and atmosphere. A great place for souvenirs! After lunch, we continue along the valley to the temple/fortress of Ollantaytambo with its enormous Inca terracing constructed on the side of a steep mountain.</p><p>Tonight you will stay in the town of Ollantaytambo.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Tika Wasi or similar .

The first day is a relatively easy 4½ hour and 13 kilometre walk. With mostly flat and light climbs, you start to witness the lush scenery of Peru. Walking slowly, you will have plenty of short breaks to ensure the group are acclimatising to the altitude.</p><p>The Inca Trail Trek can be demanding but can be completed by anyone who leads a reasonably active life - you certainly don’t need to be an athlete. Everyone is able to walk at their own pace and there is no rush to finish. The trekking group is led by an expert local guide and supported by a team of porters and cooks, leaving you with only a small day pack to carry. If you are in any doubt or if you have any condition that may affect your ability to trek, we advise that you consult your doctor.</p><p>Please Note: Due to a limited number of people being allowed on the trail a day, permits are limited and can sell out far in advance. If you wish to book the Inca Trail, please provide your Reservations Agent with your passport details by email as soon as possible so that we can secure your permit. Without your passport details, we are unable to arrange your Inca Trail Trek. Alternatively you can opt to participate in the challenging but rewarding 1 day Inca trek. Please speak to one of our travel consultants for more information or you can read more about it here. If you are not participating in either trek then you will visit Machu Picchu by train and then have plenty of free time to enjoy the activities available in and around Cusco. Meals are included for those doing the Inca Trail Trek. If you are choosing not to do the Inca Trail Trek, you will have 2-3 days to spend exploring Cusco.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in campsites on the Inca Trek .

Sitting at 4,200 metres, it is nearly 1,800 metres higher than Machu Picchu itself. The terrain here is slightly more rockier and due to open area, trekkers are more exposed to the elements, whether it’s the rain lashing down or the sun blazing down! However it can be said that traversing this part of the trail is the second most rewarding part, just after seeing Machu Picchu itself.</p><p>You will cover approximately nine kilometres in about 5-7 hours and after the high pass it's all downhill as the trail winds its way along old Inca stairs to our campsite.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in campsites on the Inca Trek .

While being the longest day, it is also the most interesting as you pass more ruins and unique sites. After roughly one hour of trekking you will come to the ruins of Runkurakay, a small circular shaped archaeological site. It has been said this site was most likely used as resting point for the Inca messengers, who maintained communication across the Inca Empire.</p><p>From this point, it is mostly downhill, and we have four more ruin sites to be discovered, with the next being Sayacmarca. Also known to historians as the “inaccessible town” due to it being barricaded on three sides with steep mountain drop offs, archaeologists remain baffled as to what the site was used for. Some say it was a viewing and control point for those headed to Machu Picchu.</p><p>We continue onto Phuyupatamarca where you can enjoy some amazing views from the top. The Quechua translation being “town in the clouds” it offers some great photo opportunities and is often used as a lunch spot for groups.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in campsites on the Inca Trek .

There will then be time to explore on your own or simply take in the magnificence of the place after your guided tour.</p><p>The Lost City of Machu Picchu was originally completely self-contained, surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to feed the population, and watered by natural springs. Located high above the fast flowing Urubamba River, the cloud shrouded ruins have palaces, baths, temples, storage rooms and some 150 houses, all in a remarkable state of preservation that will simply take your breath away.</p><p>The ruins were only discovered by the outside world in 1911, when American explorer Hiram Bingham found them while looking for another “lost city” called Vilcabamba. Due to their isolation many of the buildings are still quite intact and you can't help but admire Huayna Picchu (“Young Mountain”), which towers above the ruins.</p><p>After spending most of the day at Machu Picchu you have the chance to meander through the markets of Aguas Calientes before enjoying a scenic train ride back to the Sacred Valley where our transfer to Cusco will be waiting.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anden Inca or similar .

Take a walking tour and admire the colonial buildings or wander the colourful San Pedro Market, where you can find fruits and vegetables in abundance as well as other local delicacies.</p><p>A 45 minute walk from the centre lies Sacsayhuaman, another ancient Inca site that is well worth the journey for both the incredible views of Cusco and the interesting stonework. You can also catch a glimpse of Cristo Blanco, the large statue of Christ that towers above the city.</p><p>Spend the evening back at Plaza de Armas and experience Cusco after dark. With plenty quaint restaurants and vibrant bars around, the plaza is as lively as during the day.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anden Inca or similar .

Not only is it the largest lake in South America, it sits at 3,800 meters above sea level making it the highest navigable body of water on earth. Crystal blue waters compliment the bright yellow grass reeds used to construct the homes and boats floating upon it, while the traditional clothing simply adds to the beauty and colour of the place. While the lake tends to be overshadowed by its biodiverse and world famous neighbour the Amazon jungle, there exists over 500 aquatic species here and many various birds.</p><p>First we visit the floating reed islands in the Bay of Puno to see the Uros islanders way of life and we will have the option to ride in a traditional reed boat.</p><p>Next stop is Taquile Island, an island on Lake Titicaca still holding up many of the traditions values and customs it was built on. Learn about the way of life, from the reasons for why they do their hair the way they do and how they dress. Famous for their textiles and clothing, you will be able to pick up a homemade gift or two from the main square.</p><p>We will return to Puno for the evening.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Munay Tambo or similar .

Just about every building in La Paz is built on some sort of hill, so sightseeing will literally take your breath away! You will have time to explore La Paz and it's bustling atmosphere. Our hotel is very centrally located and is just around the corner from the city's colourful indigenous street markets including the fascinating and suitably named ?Witches Market'? where local women in traditional 'Cholita' dress sell such items as dead cats and llamas foetuses said to ward off evil spirits. The main square, Plaza Murillo, is also within walking distance. The square still retains its colonial buildings including the Presidential Palace.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Sagarnaga or similar .

Originally started as a trading post between Chili, the city is home to a small population of around 11,000 people yet welcomes close to 70,000 travellers every year who are eager to see the largest salt flat area in the world. On a clear day, the views from the plane are magical, as we fly over the huge expanse that is the Altiplano, to the Andes as you see the landscape slowly start to flatten.</p><p>Spend the afternoon relaxing in this quaint town and wander the street markets, try some local dishes or simply observe local life.</p><p>Please note: During the winter months of May-August temperatures of the Altiplano can be extremely cold, so please be prepared and pack warm clothes.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Toñito Hotel or similar .

Using 4WD vehicles, we also visit some of the most beautiful landscapes that surround the area. First on the agenda is a stop at the eery Train Cemetery, a graveyard of early 19th and 20th century steam locomotives. Perfect for some unique and artistic photographs, the cemetery represents how important Uyuni once was as a transportation hub. Next stop is Colchani, which is a small, one street town at the edge of the salt flats. Acting as the main plant for the iodisation of salt and the best place to observe the methods of salt extraction from the salar, Colchani annually processes around 25,000 tonnes of salt (out of the estimated 10 billion tonnes the Salar de Uyuni holds!)</p><p>The largest salt flat in the world, the brilliant white vast Salar de Uyuni covers some 10,500 square kilometres and looks like a surreal piece of art. With seemingly infinite horizons in front of you, the dream like atmosphere amazes visitors again and again.</p><p>After free time to take as many illusion like photos as possible, we then visit either Fish Island or Incahuasi Island, depending on the season. Located in the centre of the Salar, 100 kilometres from Uyuní, this hilly outpost is covered in giant cacti amid a flat, white sea of hexagonal salt tiles. On a clear sunny day, the blue skies complimenting the white grounds will be a view like no other.</p><p>Please note: Occasionally in the rainy season the salt flats become overly flooded and we may have to alter the itinerary if the salt flats are not safe to traverse. Your tour leader will advise as early as possible if this is likely to happen on your tour.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hostels (basic multi-share hostel) or similar .

You will see a variety of dramatic landscapes including smoking volcanoes, barren deserts and gravity-defying rock formations carved by the wind. In this incredibly empty landscape you'll most likely feel the furthest from civilisation you've ever been. You will visit  a number of lagoons including Cañapa, Chairkota and Laguna Honda. You will also get to see the Laguna Colorada, which offers some truly breathtaking scenery, with several varieties of flamingos gathering in the shallow waters of the beautiful crimson lagoon. Before arriving at Laguna Colorada you will pass Arbol de Piedra, the famous Stone Tree.</p><p>Please Note:The temperatures can get very cold and often drop below zero when crossing the Bolivian Altiplano, especially the winter months from May to September. You may wish to bring a sleeping bag if traveling in the winter months. A sleeping bag can also be rented from your Tour Leader for 70 Bolivian Bolivianos. Also note that on occasion in winter snow can cause the itinerary to be altered at short notice.</p><p>Please Note:The accommodation here is basic with limited facilities.

Here you'll discover a geyser basin with bubbling mud pots, hellish fumaroles and a thick aroma of sulphur fumes. Inside a small crater we will observe mud bubbling away and we will also stop at hot springs where you can bathe. We will pass the Desert of Salvador Dali before crossing a 5,000 metre pass. We then come to the beautiful Laguna Verde, which is shadowed by the cone of the Licancabur Volcano. Next to Laguna Verde is Laguna Blanca, known as the White Lake. Continuing on we will cross into Chile. On the way we get the chance to see both the Bolivian and Chilean sides of the 5960m Licancabur Volcano.</p><p>We then come to San Pedro de Atacama in the world's driest desert. The area is famous for the salt-covered lunar landscapes, geysers, salt flats and hot springs of the Valley of the Moon, which we will explore by van tomorrow.</p><p> Please Note: Upon exiting Bolivia you will be required to pay a small fee of 20 Bolivianos.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Don Raul or similar .

Due to its remote location and dry climate, the Atacama desert offers some of the clearest skies in the world and as such is used by international space agencies to monitor the skies. If you are lucky enough to have clear nights during your stay in San Pedro de Atacama, the starscape will most likely be the best you'll ever see.</p><p>Today we enjoy an excursion to the Valley of the Moon. The various stone formations have been formed by the wind and rain over time, resulting in unique and interesting shapes, similar to the surface of the moon. In fact, it is said a prototype of the Mars rover was tested in the area!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Don Raul or similar .

Nestled in central Chile, the city is framed by the tall and snow capped Andes mountains which on a clear day give the city the most stunning backdrop.</p><p>Santiago is a very clean, modern city with many fountains and parks, but also has its own turbulent history. It is well-known for its fresh markets such as the famous La Vega Central Market, and the Mercado Central, one of the best seafood markets in the world. You can see the changing of the guard most days outside the impressive Palacio de La Moneda, the seat of the President of Chile. In the 1970s, the palace was bombarded during the military coup d'état, ushering in a dark period in Chile’s national history.</p><p>For the best views of the city, take a funicular railway or hike to the top of San Cristobal, where the Statue of the Virgin overlooks the capital and the distant Andes. Here you can taste some of Chile's best wines and find some beautifully situated swimming pools.</p><p> Please Note: We will depart early to maximise our time in Santiago, therefore breakfast is not included on this day.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Libertador or similar .

The spectacular ice formation is around 30 kilometres in length and fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the third largest reserve of freshwater in the world. While many glaciers worldwide are currently decreasing in size, the Perito Moreno glacier is gaining just as much ice as it looses so retains its impressive size and formation.</p><p>Named after Argentine explorer Francisco Merino, the glacier is coloured in a variety of hues from blue to grey to white and continually creaks and cracks. Advancing at a speed of around two metres per day, it can put on a spectacular show when giant chunks of ice at the outermost edges crack under tremendous pressure, rupture and crash into the water – a process known as calving. You will have the chance to walk around some paths and terraces where you can get some great views of the glacier.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hostels at Glaciar del Libertador or similar .

Founded in 1985, the small town has fantastic views of the mountains that shadow over it, and was even named Argentina’s Trekking Capital.</p><p>Spend the rest of the evening enjoying the town and dine in one of the many quaint restaurants.

Our local expert guide for the day will meet us at our hotel and get us ready for today’s hike, an alternative to the traditional hike to the Fitz Roy viewpoint. Our exploration of the natural beauty of Los Glaciares National Park starts with a 40-minute transfer to El Pilar, heading north out of El Chalten, via the road leading to Lago del Desierto (Desert Lake).</p><p>Form here we start trekking along the Rio Blanco gently ascending from 500m to 800m altitude until we arrive at the Poincenot camp. On the way we will pass the Piedras Blancas Glacier viewpoint and the Piedras Blancas Lagoon as well as the Valley del Marconi and the entrance to the southern ice field. With our legs warmed up nicely, we start a steep 1km climb of rocky steps with little vegetation around to protect us from the Patagonian wind. While physically demanding, the views that receive us at the top are some of the most impressive in Patagonia. From here, on a clear day, we can see the entire Fitz Roy Massif, the Laguna de los Tres, Glacier de los Tres as well as both Laguna Sucia and Glacier Sucio, a spectacular sight. After a quick lunch, weather permitting, we begin the hour descent to Rio Blanco again before joining the traditional route straight down to El Chalten.</p><p>If you do not wish to do the Laguna de los Tres hike there are various other options available from El Chalten.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Kalenshen or similar .

your tour in Lima</name><description><p>Please always check your tour voucher before you travel.</p>
<p>Arawi Miraflores Express Hotel<br /> Calle Bol&amp;iacute;var 464<br /> Miraflores<br /> Lima<br />Peru</p>
<p>Tel: (+51) 1 7434660</p>
<p>Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques in the hotel when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you. Be careful of pickpockets everywhere, but especially on the pedestrian street Jiron de la Union. It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major South American cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Lima</h5>
<p>On arrival in Lima, we recommend you change enough money into the local currency (the Peruvian nuevo sol) for the first four or five days of your trip. This is especially important if you are arriving on a Saturday night. The bank is located on the far right as you enter the baggage claim area after passing through passport control. There is an ATM in the airport arrivals area which will give you Peruvian soles or US dollars, so make sure you pay attention when it asks you which currency you want.</p>
<p>ATMs in Peru do not always automatically release your credit or debit card at the time when you receive your money. Please be aware that you sometimes have to push a button to request your card to be returned. Many ATMs in main towns have instructions in English.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you decide not to pre-book an arrival transfer, you can either take a taxi from one of hundreds of touts outside or arrange a taxi at one of the pre-pay taxi desks just after customs. Recommended companies include Taxi CMV and Taxi Mitsui Remise. For safety and convenience, we recommend you use the taxi desks as haggling with touts and taxi drivers can be very difficult, particularly if you do not speak Spanish. The cost of a taxi from the airport to our hotel in downtown Lima should be approximately US$15 to $25. The airport is approximately 30 to 45 minutes from the city centre (depending on the traffic).</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Don't take unmarked taxis in Lima, and preferably don't travel alone by taxi, particularly late at night.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a great variety of accommodation, providing you with unique experiences to last a lifetime! Below is a breakdown of what types of accommodation you will stay in during this tour:</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<p><strong>Inca Trail Trek</strong> - You will be camping in comfy tents (2 people max per tent) on your way to Machu Picchu. The tents are equipped with sleeping mats but you will need to bring a sleeping bag or rent one from the Tour Leader for US$15. Each campsite has toilet blocks, but you should ensure you pack toilet roll as this is rarely available. For more information on what to pack please <a href="the-inca-trail">click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Jungle lodge</strong> - The bungalows used in the Amazon Jungle are eco-friendly and made from local materials. Each room is equipped with meshing to keep them bug free and they all have basic private bathrooms. There is potable water available at the lodge, so you just need to bring a refillable bottle to the Amazon Jungle. Please note, hot water may be limited. Electricity is also limited so phones and cameras should be charged as much as possible before arrival.</p>
<p><strong>Uyuni Salt Flats</strong> - You will spend one night in a traditional local hostel made from salt blocks. The rooms are multi-share with up to 4 people per room with communal bathrooms and showers. There is limited hot water and towels are not normally provided so you should ensure you bring your own. We highly recommend taking a sleeping bag as it can get incredibly cold at high altitude at night. Unless you have rented one for the Inca Trail, you will already have one for this. It is essential to have warm clothes. The lighting and power are on for limited hours and there are communal charging stations available. Accommodation in the salt flats in sparse and the area is very under-developed, meaning there is no light pollution. While the facilities here are basic, standing under the clear night sky is a wonderful experience!</p>
<p><strong>Laguna Colorada National Park</strong> - In Laguna Colorada National Park you will stay in a local hostel with multi-share rooms with up to 7 people per room. There are communal bathrooms however there is no hot water and no showers. There is also no heating and so it can be very cold in winter and again warm clothes are essential. There are no power outlets or charging stations so ensure all your electronics are fully charged and it&amp;rsquo;s also recommended to take a portable charger with you.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. The only locations where you will be in multi-share dorms are Uyuni Salt Flats and Laguna Colorada National Park.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans. The mode of transport is chosen based on schedule and timings, comfort, group size, location and reliability.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport.</p>
<h5>Flights</h5>
<p>There are a total of 8 flights included on this tour so you should pay particular attention to the weight limit of your luggage. Tucan Travel tours have a checked luggage restriction of up to 20kg in total.

</ul></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>This extensive adventure will cover various countries and climates, therefore it's important to pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold in some locations, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<h5>Flights</h5>
<p>If your tour includes internal flights please be aware there is often a restriction of 15kg for checked baggage. If your luggage exceeds this weight you will need to pay any fees incurred.</p>
<p>In general, South America is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis.</p>
<h5>What essential items should I bring to South America?</h5>
<ul>
<li>A small daypack - This should have enough room to carry food and snacks for long hikes or day trips.</li>
<li>These are essential for the Inca Trail Trek and Patagonia. These do not need to be expensive boots, but they should have good ankle support and grip, be worn in and ideally waterproof.</li>
<li>For the Inca Trail you will need to pack a sleeping bag. There is the option to rent sleeping bags for US$15 from your Tour Leader, but they are subject to availability. You may choose to carry a sleeping bag liner/sleep sheet with you. These are very compact and can come in handy on long travel days. You may also need your sleeping bag for crossing the Bolivian Salt Flats, where the hostels generally have no heating and temperatures can be very cold at night.</li>
<li>Insect Repellent (DEET 35% min) and bite cream.</li>
<li>Layers - We recommend packing lightweight and durable clothes. Nights can be cold at higher altitude so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</li>
<li>Waterproofs. The weather in Peru and Patagonia can be unpredictable and you will need waterproof clothing for the hikes.</li>
<li>Towel - You will need a towel for the hostels in Uyuni Salt Flats and Laguna Colorada National Park. Towels also come in handy at many points of the tour and for the beaches in Rio!</li>
<li>Portable Electronics Charger - There will be limited to no charging facilities on the Inca Trail, Amazon Jungle, Uyuni Salt Flats and Laguna Colorada. If you wish to keep your phone and camera charged you will want to ensure you bring a portable charger that holds a few charges.</li>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms. There will be no laundry facilities on the Inca Trail, Amazon Jungle, Torres del Paine National Park, Uyuni Salt Flats or Laguna Colorada National Park.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses various different currencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peruvian Sol</li>
<li>Bolivian Boliviano</li>
<li>Chilean Peso</li>
<li>Argentinian Peso</li>
<li>Brazilian Real</li>
</ul>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is part of life in South America. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Tipping on the Inca Trail</h5>
<p>This tour includes the tip for your porters, guides and chef for the full four day Inca Trail Trek.</p>
<h5>Free Walking Tours</h5>
<p>Free walking tours are found in many of the large cities. These are marketed as free walking tours and are designed to provide travellers with local, in depth knowledge of the city. However all free walking tours are tip based (they have to make money somehow, after all!) and so if you wish to join a free walking tour you need to budget in a tip at the end. Leaving a free walking tour that was considered a good tour without tipping is very disrespectful and will only give travellers a bad reputation.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of Asian cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p>
<p>Overall the food scene in South America is incredible and you will get to experience everything from local lunches in rural areas to high end restaurants in the bigger cities. The markets in Cusco and the Central Market in Santiago are especially good to pick up some local treats. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>South America has some amazing markets selling delicious food. Eating at local markets is a great way to experience authentic food and at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p></description></item><item><name>Important Itinerary Notes</name><description><p>On this tour you can choose between the four day Inca Trail Trek, the one day Inca Trail Hike or the train to Machu Picchu. Please note that the Inca Trail Trek is closed in February.</p>
<h5>Train to Machu Picchu</h5>
<p>If you prefer not to trek, you can take the train to Machu Picchu. This is included in the tour price at no extra charge. Read more about the train here.</p>
<h5>One day Inca Trail Trek</h5>
<p>If you do not want to do the complete four day Inca Trail Trek, you can do a portion of it on the one day trek. This is perfect for passengers who want do not want to camp or who want to spend more time in Cusco. Read more about it here.</p>
<h5>Inca Trail Trek</h5>
<p>This tour includes the famous Inca Trail trek. The Inca Trail trek is a permit regulated activity which can have limited availability and sometimes sells out months in advance. It is closed in February for maintenance. Permits are booked with your passport details which must be provided to us in writing. We cannot guarantee permit availability until we have received your deposit, passport details in writing and have applied for your permit with the government-run office in Cusco. Additional advice on the Inca Trail can be found here.</p>
<h5>Uyuni Salt Flats and Laguna Colorada National Park</h5>
<p>This tour visits the incredible Uyuni Salt Flats and Laguna Colorada National Park. Due to the remote location accommodation options are limited and facilities are basic. Please refer to the accommodation section for further information.</p>
<h5>Tayrona National Park</h5>
<p>Tayrona National Park is normally closed at various times throughout the year so that the local communities are given time to clean the park and perform traditional rituals. In 2020 these dates will be 1st and 15th February, 1st and 15th June, and 19th October and 2nd November. If you are travelling while the park is closed you will have a different but equally exciting tour inside Taironaka Nature Reserve where you will be escorted by a local guide for a short walk through the lush rainforest, and will then have the relaxing experience of tubing down the Don Dieguito river while taking in the local flora and fauna. The river is shallow and very calm so it is not necessary to be an advanced swimmer to enjoy this unique experience.</p>
<h5>Patagonia</h5>
<p>This trip includes 10 days in Patagonia. There are various hiking trails here and passengers should have a decent level of fitness to complete these - with the longest trek being 24km. The three nights in Torres del Paine are spent camping. Facilities at the campsite are basic however there are toilets and showers with hot water. Passengers will be responsible for erecting their own tents with assistance from the tour leader. A single supplement is not available during this period.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in South America</h5>
<p>South America is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Altitude Sickness</h5>
<p>All clients warrant and accept that there is a chance they may get some form of altitude sickness on itineraries that generally travel to altitudes over 2,400 metres though Tucan Travel will not expose clients to any undue risk of altitude sickness. Tucan Travel tour leaders, staff and local suppliers working at higher altitudes will have some level of knowledge and / or training on how to help and advise you. Please read the information contained <a href="high-altitude-sickness">here</a> to ensure you understand the risks and what to do in this event.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip.
