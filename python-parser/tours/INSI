The city has been destroyed and rebuilt seven times in its long history. Distances are long in the city and walking to places can be futile. Take a bike rickshaw or a motorised rickshaw to get around some of the sites. You can visit the Gandhi Memorial Museum or the infamous Red Fort, maybe make your way to Humayun's Tomb in south Delhi, near Hazrat Nizamuddin station, one of Delhi's three UNESCO World Heritage Sites. A popular way to discover Delhi for many people is to take a bicycle rickshaw tour and check out the view from Jama Masjid, the largest mosque in India.</p><p>Included on your tour is an orientation walk through the Karol Burgh area in Delhi. This excursion is only available in the evening of the first day of your tour, before your pre-departure meeting. Ask a member of the reservations team for more details.</p><p>Tucan Travel's group tours operate on a modular system with smaller tour sections joining the main tour throughout its duration. Please note that on this tour, you will join the main India and Nepal tour in Agra/Jaipur . Upon your arrival to Delhi, your Tour leader will have left information for you at the hotel reception and a time to meet the local Tucan Travel guide who will provide a brief pre- departure meeting and your bus/train tickets to join the main tour in Agra/Jaipur. The Tucan Travel local guide will also escort you to the bus/train station to ensure that your boarding is easy and problem free. Upon arrival at Agra/Jaipur you will be met by your Tour Leader who will escort you to the hotel to join your new friends at the hotel.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

It is known as the 'pink city' because of its pink wash buildings although time has faded some of this colour. Make sure you check out the Old City with its bazaars, palaces and havelis. There's also the popular Nahargarh (Tiger Fort) which is a small fort with towering walls. You may also wish to go on a group visit to Hawa Mahal (Palace of the Winds) which is one of Jaipur's most famous attractions - a five storey high Baroque- like structure built to enable the veiled ladies of the harem to observe the street scenes below, out of sight of the people below.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Jai Niwas or similar .

your tour in Delhi</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Hotel Perfect<br />16A/2,W.E.A Karol Bagh<br />Near New Bloom School<br />New Delhi<br />110005</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong> your joining hotel can be subject to change. Always refer to the hotel listed on your final documentation sent by your adventure specialist.</p>
<p>There are safe deposit boxes for your use (you will get an itemised receipt). Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you.It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Delhi</h5>
<p>Delhi&amp;rsquo;s Indira Gandhi International Airport has been reincarnated out of sight of its original infamy as one of the world&amp;rsquo;s worst airports. On arrival we recommend that you obtain some Indian rupees as soon as you arrive. There are money exchange offices offering a good rate inside the airport. International ATMs are available inside the airport.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<p>Contact your arrival transfer:<br /> Contact: Delhi Operations Team<br /> Phone: +91 (0) 9999780391</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel, you can take a taxi or use the metro system. A pre-paid taxi is probably the less stressful option of the two.</p>
<p>You can pay for a taxi at the pre-paid taxi booths in the international terminal (it is advised that you check your change). The pre-paid booths are visible as soon as you exit customs. The one on the left is managed by the Delhi police. To the right of the exit door are private taxi operators. They are more expensive but the cars are air-conditioned. The number of the taxi assigned to you will be on the receipt. Then, go straight through the airport and turn right immediately outside the front doors and someone will help you find your taxi. There are several options, but the booth operated by the "Delhi Police" is considered the best, and with them a non-air conditioned taxis to most points in the city costing 200-300 rupees (US$4-$7) Keep an eye on your change though and try to avoid paying with large bills.</p>
<p>Delhi&amp;rsquo;s metro system operates from terminal 3 to New Delhi station and tickets are 150 rupees. From the metro station you should take a taxi or auto-rickshaw to the hotel. The contrast between the modern, air-conditioned metro system and arriving at New Delhi station can be jarring, so relax and take your time. As you exit the Metro, you will see the New Delhi train station and you will need to climb the stairs and take the over-bridge to the Paharganj side (the Metro exit is on the Ajmeri Gate side) where there is a pre-paid taxi booth run by the Delhi Police. New Delhi station is large, crowded, confusing and full of touts - ignore strangers that approach you offering help. If you do not take a pre-paid taxi, ensure your taxi or rickshaw driver turns on their meter. Auto-rickshaw drivers are particularly reluctant to use their meters, so you must insist they do this.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a variety of hotels. You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. If you wish to book a double bed, please advice your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>
<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on most occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans. The mode of transport is chosen based on schedule and timings, comfort, group size, location and reliability. Transport in India is generally comfortable and all part of the adventure.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport.</p></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cooler depending on the season you are travelling, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus a thinner sweater which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, India is a conservative country and you should keep your legs and shoulders covered when out in public.</p>

<h5>Laundry</h5>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p>
<h5>E-Cigarettes</h5>
<p>Please be aware that India has banned the use of e-cigarettes and it is not possible to bring them into the country with you.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the Indian rupee.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in the larger cities will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>

<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of Indian culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost unless stated as included in the itinerary. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In India and Nepal, there is a huge choice of incredible food.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>

<h5>Safety in India</h5>
<p>India is generally safe, even more so in a group tour. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<p>Travel Insurance</p>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<p>Pack a Medical Kit</p>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<p>Vaccinations</p>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera, Diphtheria and influenza.</p>
<p>Horse Riding</p>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them.
