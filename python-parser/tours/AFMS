Kenya’s capital city is a hub for business and culture with an inner population of around 3.5 million.</p><p>You are free to arrive today at your leisure. If you wish to go exploring, we recommend seeking local advice from the hotel about where is safe to walk. Petty theft is unfortunately common in Nairobi and you should remain vigilant at all times.</p><p>There will be a pre departure meeting tonight to meet your tour leader and fellow travellers.

On arrival we get straight into our first game drive in one of the world's most famous and expansive wildlife reserves.</p><p>Covering over 1,500 square kilometres and providing habitat for thousands of animals, the Masai Mara Nature Reserve is deservedly one of Kenya’s most popular safari spots. Animals present in the reserve include the big five (lions, elephants, Cape buffaloes, leopards and rhinoceros), various grazing mammals which attract carnivores such as cheetahs, hyenas and jackals, and over 500 recorded species of birds. We stay just outside the park in permanent tents, enjoying a buffet dinner in the evening.</p><p>The following morning we leave camp early for a second game drive, visiting the mighty Mara River. During the annual Great Migration, this is the setting for the thunderous display of thousands of wildebeest crossing the river while canny crocodiles lie in wait. At any time of year, the river is vitally important to the ecosystem and a good spot to view animals. You will also have the opportunity to visit a local Masai village, learning about the vibrant, semi-nomadic herders’ way of life and join them in a local dance.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in tented camps at Miti Mingi Eco Camp or similar .

We’re picked up after breakfast and taken by 4WD to the national park. The afternoon is spent game driving to our lodge, located inside the national park to maximise our time and wildlife viewing opportunities.</p><p>Before we reach the Serengeti plains, we’ll stop for a stunning vista overlooking the Ngorongoro Crater, the largest unbroken, unflooded caldera in the world. The vast 300 square kilometre crater stretches out in front of you in a kaleidoscope of blues and greens and it’s not until you spot the barely discernible grey speck of an elephant that you truly grasp its scale.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in lodges .

Among the hundreds of species in the park, you may encounter zebra, giraffe, wildebeest, buffalo, lion, cheetah, leopard, hippopotamus, hyena, elephant, vulture, monkey, warthog, gazelle and impala.

your tour in Nairobi</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Kenya Comfort Hotel <br />Muindi Mbingu / Monrovia Street (opposite Jeevanjee Gardens)<br />Nairobi</p>
<p>Tel: (+254) 734608866<br /> comfort@kenyacomfort.com<br /> www.kenyacomfort.com/index.php/kchhome.html</p>
<h5>Arriving in Nairobi</h5>
<p>Ensure you have your onward flight ticket, tour voucher and travel itinerary on your person when arriving at immigration. We recommend that you obtain some Kenyan Shillings at Nairobi International Airport. There is a Barclays bank and ATM on your left hand side as you exit the arrivals area. The ATM is available 24 hours and Barclays are open 6am-10pm. There is also the Taipan FX bureau which gives a better rate if you are changing cash or travellers cheques; they are open 8am-5pm daily. At both Barclays and the Taipan you will need your purchase receipt if you are changing traveller&amp;rsquo;s cheques.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact address below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from the joining hotel, you can book transport though them and they will provide a transfer for between US$20 and US$40 for up to six people. Airport taxis in Nairobi can work out to be expensive.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>One of the exciting elements of travelling in Africa, is the different styles of accommodation stayed in whilst on tour. You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites.</p>
<h5>Important notes on African Accommodation</h5>
<p>Travelling in Africa is about the experience. Many of the countries we travel through are still developing and therefore accommodation is likely to differ to what you may be used to. In remote locations, many lodges and camps rely on generators for electricity and power shortages are not uncommon. All of the accommodation we use includes bedding and real beds - so you do not need to bring a sleeping bag at any point of this tour. Please note, that some accommodation includes a shared bathroom and shower facilities. WI-FI is available in most locations however it can be very unreliable, especially in the national parks. Expect to be offline for a few days and if you are able to connect - it's a bonus!</p>
<p><strong>Permanent Tents</strong> - This tour includes stays in permanent tents which will be equipped with beds and mosquito nets. In some locations the tents will have an en-suite bathroom whilst others have a shared bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Rondavels</strong> - Rondavels are round, African-style huts which make for wonderfully unique accommodation. They have real beds and basins in the huts, however toilets and showers are shared in near-by abolition blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Lodges</strong> - Lodges will vary depending on the location.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless. If you are a solo passenger you will be sharing a room with another group member of the same sex. If you are travelling with a partner and wish to book a double bed, please advice your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of private vehicles and the Tucan Travel Overland Truck. You can read more about them <a href="overland-holidays">here</a>. The overland truck is a Mercedes-Benz custom built for us! Each is named after a past Tucan Travel colleague and they are some of the biggest and brightest overland vehicles on the road. Each truck tackles tough Africa terrain in its stride, and towers above the ground. They are equipped with big windows to open - perfect for wildlife spotting on game drives in Kruger National Park.</p>
<p>The truck is equipped with the following features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mostly forward-facing seats &amp;amp; seat belts</li>
<li>Water tanks &amp;amp; storage for bulk supplies</li>
<li>Access to the drivers compartment</li>
<li>Plenty of headroom to store your daypacks</li>
<li>Large external compartments for your rucksacks</li>
<li>Power sockets &amp;amp; adaptors to charge your gadgets</li>
<li>Panoramic, tinted &amp;amp; sliding windows for epic views</li>
<li>A safe for passports &amp;amp; valuables</li>
<li>A fridge to keep your food fresh</li>
<li>A library filled with board games &amp;amp; books</li>
<li>Two tables, great for playing games</li>
</ul>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport. Please limit yourself to one piece of luggage per person plus one smaller day bag.</p>
<h5>Approximate travel times on this trip</h5>
<p>The below information provides approximate travel times and modes of transport for your tour. Please note that modes of transport may be subject to change depending on the group size and timings may vary depending on the season and border crossings on the day. This is especially apt for Africa and we like to think it's all part of the adventure!</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the transport below will be on the Overland Truck.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nairobi to the Masai Mara - 5h</li>
<li>The Masai Mara to Nairobi - 5h</li>
<li>Nairobi to Arusha - 6h</li>
<li>Arusha to the Serengeti - 5h plus game drives by 4WD</li>
<li>The Serengeti to Arusha via Ngorongoro Crater - 4h30 by 4WD</li>
</ul>
</description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>Below are the currencies which are used on this tour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenyan shilling</li>
<li>Tanzanian shilling</li>
</ul>
<p>As you travel through Africa you will be able to exchange either USD or other African currencies so you do not need to bring local currency for each destination before the tour.</p>
<p>Most optional excursions are listed in US dollar. While many of the more expensive excursions, such as hot air ballooning, can be paid in USD you will need local currency for most excursions.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in larger cities will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card. In more remote locations, you should always ensure you have a supply of cash.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. On long travel days, lunch will sometimes be served by your tour leader from the truck. Details of this can be found in the itinerary. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is generally a part of life in Africa. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p>

</description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>Please consider which season you are travelling in and pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer. Colours are important if you are embarking on a safari drive. Opt for muted colours that will blend into the bush - such as browns, khaki and beige. Remember that the roads are dusty and you're clothing might get dirty so don't take expensive items.</p>
<p>What essential items should I bring to Africa?</p>
<ul>
<li>A lightweight and waterproof jacket.</li>
<li>Good, comfortable walking shoes are essential. There can either be comfortable trainers or walking shoes.</li>
<li>A small daypack - This should have enough room to carry food and snacks for long hikes and treks and space to carry belongings.</li>
<li>Layers- We recommend packing lightweight and durable clothes. On the Gorilla Trek you will need to wear long trousers and sleeves to protect yourself within the jungle.</li>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included and lunch and dinner may be included on long travel days. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of African cities, there is a decent choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to meeting your tour please call (+44) 788 7498 617.</p>
<h5>Safety in Africa</h5>
<p>Africa is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. You may need several vaccinations and/or malaria tablets and you should be aware that some vaccinations require more than one visit and can take several weeks to administer. Always carry your International Certificate of Vaccination with your passport. For areas with malaria, make sure you pack sufficient prophylactics for the duration of your tour and the incubation period after. Most countries in Africa prevent entry for travellers without a valid Yellow Fever certificate. This must be acquired before departure and takes ten days for your body to build up a resistance. This certificate must be taken with you on your tour with a photocopy stored somewhere safe.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.

<p>A yellow fever vaccination is required if you are travelling to/from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission in Africa; this includes transiting through a yellow fever risk country. The majority of our tours in Africa aside from Morocco, require a yellow fever certificate therefore we highly recommend that you obtain this prior to travel. Please make sure that on arrival you have a valid yellow fever certificate ready for inspection by local customs or health authorities, otherwise you could be refused entry or quarantined.</p>
