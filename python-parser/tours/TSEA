You will be transferred from the airport to your hotel and have the remainder of the day free to relax and start exploring.</p><p>Lima was founded by the Spanish Conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 1535 after he eradicated the Incas and made the city his capital. It has many beautiful colonial buildings and some of the best museums in South America including the Gold Museum, Museum of the Inquisition and the Catacombs below the San Francisco Church. Peru's capital has much to offer and many of the sights, including the city's two main squares the Plaza de Armas and Plaza San Martin, are within easy walking distance The Plaza de Armas houses the Cathedral, Municipal Palace and Presidential Palace where the changing of the guard can be seen every day at 12 noon. There are also many markets in Lima, possibly the best being in the central district.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

On arrival, you will be welcomed by the staff at the Inkaterra Lounge (Butterfly House) who will prepare you for your Amazon Jungle adventure. The first leg of our journey is by bus followed by canoe, along the Madre de Dios River to your rustic yet chic, comfortable jungle lodge situated in the middle of the lush rainforest. On arrival, enjoy a delicious lunch using fresh organic ingredients and native flavours.</p><p>After lunch you will set off on a trek through the rainforest along wooden walkways. On the way your guide will stop to show you various species of bird and explain the medicinal plants and delicate ecological systems of the Amazon Jungle. The scenery is extremely varied incorporating dense jungle as well as marsh areas. You will see incredibly big trees, several metres in diametre and around 450 years old. As dusk falls you will enjoy a canoe ride drifting along the river, observing nocturnal wildlife emerging from the jungle. You will then return to the lodge for dinner.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a jungle lodge .

Navigate a canoe across an oxbow lake, home to the giant river otter, howler monkey and macaw as well as the biggest freshwater scaled fish, the paiche. After a delicious lunch you will enjoy stunning vistas as you ascend to the rainforest canopy walkways and cross the bridges that connect the treetops. It is an amazing opportunity to marvel at the vast size of the rainforest by getting a glimpse of just a tiny sliver of it. From the canopy walkways, you may be able to see canopy wildlife such as parrots, three toed sloths,toucans, and squirrel monkeys.</p><p>Tonight you can explore the jungle further as you hike in the jungle on a nocturnal walk. Your senses are heightened as you listen out for the many sounds of the jungle, from crickets to insects, birds chirping and monkeys howling, with a limited sense of vision, you will be all the more aware of these noises before returning to the lodge for a well deserved dinner</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a jungle lodge .

On arrival, you will be met and transferred to your hotel by private vehicle. A UNESCO World Heritage site, Cuzco was the capital of the Inca Empire and traces of its past can be found around nearly every corner. From old Incan walkways to beautiful well preserved colonial architecture, Cuzco has a varied history that is evident at a glance.</p><p>This afternoon you will join a group to explore the churches and cathedral around the charming Plaza de Armas. Your next stop will be the complex of Koricancha which contained the Temple of the Sun, the most sacred site in the Inca religion. It was the centrepiece of a vast astronomical observatory. Little remains of it today except for sections of its stone walls which hint at the sites once massive size. The Christian monastery of Santo Domingo was built on top of the complex, no doubt to signify that one religion had been replaced by another. Afterwards, you will drive to the nearby ruins of Sacsayhuaman which reveal the Incas extraordinary architecture. Like all Inca constructions, the stones fit together perfectly without mortar and it would be hard to fit a single sheet of paper even between the biggest. It took almost one hundred years and thousands of men to complete.</p><p>Next it is on to a site shrouded in mystery, the large rock and intricate complex of Qenko. The site is named for the zigzag channels carved into the rock which are believed to have been used by Inca priests to pour sacred chicha or llama blood into as part of an annual ritual. Tambomachay is thought to be have been used to worship water as the source of life. Two aqueducts, artistically carved on the rock, transport and keep a constant flow of clean water. Your final stop is the red fortress of Puka Pukara which took its name from the colour of the stones (especially at dusk).</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Whilst this is a full day of driving, there are plenty of stops along the way to stretch your legs and to appreciate some of the history that this route, ‘The Route of the Sun’, holds.</p><p>Your first stop will take in the Andahuaylillas church, also known as the Sistine Chapel of the Americas thanks to its intricately painted ceilings and other murals. Jump back on the bus and whilst your journey takes you onwards, your next stop takes you further back in time. Built in the fifteenth century, Raqchi is considered by historians to be one of the most audacious Inca constructions. The remarkable Wiracocha temple, 100 metres long and 20 metres wide is made of adobe walls, built on top of volcanic stone foundations.</p><p>You will then stop for lunch in the picturesque Sicuani before driving over La Raya Pass where there is a stunning view across to the snow-capped mountains and over a beautiful old chapel, standing alone in the middle of the Andean plateau. Your final stop is the archaeological site of Pukara which dates back to approximately the first century. The small museum here has items of the lithic Pukara culture.</p><p>You will arrive in Puno in the early evening and you will then be taken to your hotel by private vehicle. Puno is located on the banks of Lake Titicaca, the world's highest navigable lake and stands at an impressive 3,800 metres above sea level. According to legend, it was on this lake that the Sun God commanded his children, Mama Ocllo and Manco Cápac, to give birth to the Inca civilisation.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

The ancient Uros were originally forced to take up residence on the floating islands when the Incas expanded onto their land and the mobility of the islands was a defence mechanism. Totora reed, which is plentiful along the edges of the lake, is used to make homes, furniture, boats and the islands they stand on. As reeds disintegrate from the bottom of the islands, which are four to eight feet thick, residents must add more to the surface. Each island has a collection of simple reed houses but they are not short of modern conveniences such as solar panels and televisions.</p><p>Later you will travel on to Taquile, an island untouched by the mainland\'s modernity. The local inhabitants, known as Taquileños, still wear traditional clothing and are known for their high-quality handicrafts. Since 1970, the islands have been governed by the Taquileños and visitors are greeted by these ancient communities and have the opportunity to share their ways of life. While the women make yarn and weave, knitting is done exclusively by men. Pre-Inca vestiges are found in the highest part of the island. You will return to your hotel in Puno in the afternoon and the evening is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

You will change drivers and vehicle at the border and your driver from Puno will help you cross the border. You will arrive in the late evening and you are then free at your leisure. The city sits within a narrow canyon and it has breath-taking views or it could just be the altitude as you are in the highest capital city in the world. A central cluster of church spires sits dwarfed by the magnificent icebound peak of Mount Illimani and two very distinct societies – the indigenous and the European – coexist with international banks sitting beside street markets selling ritual paraphernalia used in Aymara customs</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Walk the narrow, meandering streets of Rosario, San Jorge and San Miguel, some of La Paz's oldest and liveliest neighbourhoods. Pass through the witches' market, in the middle of the city where Aymara women in traditional Altiplanic petticoats and bowler hats sell medicinal herbs and spices. There are a number of spiritual artefacts as well including, surprisingly, mummified llama foetuses which are supposed to bring good luck in traditional culture.</p><p>As you walk down from the stalls, you will come to the San Francisco cathedral, one of the oldest and largest cathedrals in the city and home to some impressive examples of colonial-era religious art. At the Plaza Murillo, your guide will point out the Presidential Palace and the National Congress, all impressive colonial edifices in the oldest quarter of the city. You can also visit the Costumes Museum and Gold Museum, located on one of the most traditional and oldest street in La Paz.</p><p>Your next stop will be the unique Moon Valley, a fascinating geological anomaly so called because of its bizarre, moon-like landscape. Valle de la Luna has a few kilometres of walking paths that run through the huge stalagmites and trenches of the valley, carved out over centuries of erosion by the wind and rain. In addition to its fascinating geology, there are some impressive views of the Andes Mountains of the Cordillera Real outside the city.</p><p>The afternoon is then free for you to explore as you wish. You will find that the colourful markets on Sagarnaga Street have some of the best shopping in La Paz. The Mercado Lanza, famous for its Api, a hot yellow or purple drink made with cornmeal and traditionally enjoyed with a fresh cheese empanada makes a great refuelling stop.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Make sure your camera is fully charged and the memory card is empty before you begin as the salt flats and surrounding landscapes provide spectacular and surreal photo opportunities. In the wet season a shimmering layer of water covers part of the area and creates eerie reflections. Located at 3,660 metres above sea level, the salt flat can be cold and windy, so wrap up warm for your big day out. Tonight you will overnight in a salt hotel.</p><p>The following day you will continue on through the high desert of Pampas de Dali until you reach Laguna Verde, a beautiful green lagoon in the foothills of Licancabur Mountain. From there you will travel to the Chilean border at Hito Cajon where you will be transferred to your accommodation in San Pedro de Atacama. In the afternoon you will have a half day tour of the Moon Valley (Valle de la Luna).</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

On arrival, you will be greeted by your Tucan Travel representative who will transfer you to your hotel. Once you have checked in to your hotel, the remainder of the day is free to explore this cosmopolitan capital city at your own pace.</p><p>Nestled in central Chile, the city is framed by the tall and snow capped Andes mountains which on a clear day give the city the most stunning backdrop.</p><p>For the best views of the city, take a funicular railway to the top of San Cristobal where the Statue of the Virgin overlooks the capital and the distant Andes. Here you can taste some of Chile's best wines and find some beautifully situated swimming pools. Santiago is a very clean, modern city with many fountains and parks, and is well-renowned for its markets such as the famous Mercado Central, one of the best seafood markets in the world. In the Plaza Constitution at the Palacio de la Moneda, you can see the changing of the guard on most days.</p><p>The next day you will be collected for a half day tour where you can sample delicious local wines set amongst stunning scenery. When Spanish conquerors arrived in Chile they were hunting for gold, but found perfect winemaking conditions instead. The Maipo Valley winemaking tradition dates back to the 16th century and remains one of Chile?s most productive regions, particularly well known for its excellent Cabernet Sauvignon.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

On arrival, you will begin an unforgettable experience in one of the most beautiful and moving places on the planet. Torres del Paine is named after three massive granite towers that rise out of the earth and offer an unforgettable backdrop to an already-striking region. Covering more than 180,000 hectares, the park boasts stunning scenery with snow covered mountain peaks, glaciers, beautiful lakes and valleys with a diverse variety of unusual flora and fauna. Some of the varied and amazing creatures you might spot include skunks, Andean condors, black-chested buzzard eagles, chilla foxes, culpeo foxes, guanacos (a relative of the llama), Chilean flamingos and rhea. Vividly-coloured flowers, various evergreen plants and orchids may also be seen. The best way to discover the national park is on foot and trekking here will take your breath away.</p><p>The following day you can enjoy a range of activities such as horse riding, trekking and guided vehicle tours.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

There are many guided walks on offer which showcase the best of the national park and where you can witness some amazing glacial views.</p><p>Some of the walks are quite demanding, and at a high altitude, but there are a good range of options for all grades of walkers. One such trek offers incredible views of the famous ?towers?, the three distinctive granite peaks of the Paine mountain range. It?s quite challenging, with the whole route being 19km, however it is well worth it. For the longer treks such as the ?towers? walk, a reasonable level of fitness is required and passengers must be prepared for all weather conditions. We recommend packing trekking boots, waterproof trousers and a positive outlook to all weather!</p><p>If you feel you need to give your legs a rest, go horse riding through the valleys for some of the most picturesque views from horseback.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

With a height of approximately 60 metres and a front of five kilometres (three miles), covering some 250 square kilometres, the glacier is an incredible sight and is one of the few glaciers in the world to be growing slightly, not decreasing in size as most glaciers do. Named after Argentine explorer Francisco  Moreno, the glacier is coloured in a variety of hues from blue to grey to white and continually creaks and cracks. Advancing at a speed of around two metres per day, it can put on a spectacular show when giant chunks of ice at the outermost edges crack under tremendous pressure, rupture and crash into the water- a process known as calving. You will have the chance to walk around the paths and terraces where you will get some great views of the glacier and you will also take a boat ride around the glacier to get even closer.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Take in the breath-taking natural wonders, Patagonian lakes and charming scenery in the world's southernmost National Park. As you enter the park, you will be surrounded by native Lenga beech and Ñire forests, sour-cherry trees, rivers, lakes and peat bogs; components that make the landscape indescribably beautiful and typically Patagonian. Visit Ensenada Bay and you will be left speechless by the incredible outlook from the shore which reveals spectacular views of the Beagle Channel, Lapataia Bay and Redonda Island. You will continue on your journey to Lake Roca. Take a further stroll along the shore of the lake to try to see one of the inhabitants of the park - the beavers, an introduced species that have wreaked havoc on some of the areas within the park.</p><p>This afternoon you will then journey in Charles Darwin’s footsteps and set out from the dock to sail along Ushuaia bay and the Beagle channel from where you will enjoy beautiful views of the city, its main buildings and Olivia and Cinco Hermanos hills. Sail on towards Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse where you will see a cormorant rookery. On your way back, you will get closer to Sea Lion Island to see these animals in their natural habitat, as well as seabirds such as the imperial cormorants, albatross and skuas among others. The evening is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Once you have checked in, the remainder of the day is at your leisure. Buenos Aires is an astonishing metropolis that looks a little like Europe, but with a Latin American twist; indeed it is known as the Paris of the Americas. The city's residents, Portenos ("people from the port"), are passionate and friendly.</p><p>This evening you could head out to watch Argentina's most famous dance, the passionate and dramatic Tango. Folklore has it that it began in the bordellos of long-ago Buenos Aires as men waiting for their 'ladies' passed time by dancing amongst themselves. Today, tango shows are supremely entertaining with their grand feats of athleticism.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
