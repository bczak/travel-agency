Many villagers live a traditional life as little changed since pre-Columbian times and they still wear richly-woven costumes, the colours and designs varying from place to place. The scenery is breath-taking - volcanic landscapes, beautiful lakes surrounded by forest-cloaked volcanoes and tropical rainforest, much of which hides vast complexes from ancient civilisations. The Spanish also left their mark, most notably in Antigua with its shady plazas and colonial houses and courtyards.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

The city flourished between about 200 and 900 AD and has became overgrown by the encroaching rainforest and was lost to the world. In the seventeenth century its existence began to draw global attention and from 1956, the site has begun to be excavated and archaeologists continue to uncover more of the site, increasing the understanding of the history of the civilisations that made Tikal their home.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Towering above the jungle canopy, the temples rise through the thick jungle canopy reaching nearly 230 feet. Vast open plazas, towering pyramids and extraordinary carvings and stelae make up the site, some of which date as far back as the fourth century BC. As you walk around, your knowledgeable guide will explain the significance of the structures and the ancient rituals that were once performed in them. Due to its remote jungle location, the site is also a haven for wildlife and as you explore, you will no doubt run into abundant wildlife such as coatis, wild turkeys, howler monkeys and other species. The remainder of the day is free at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
