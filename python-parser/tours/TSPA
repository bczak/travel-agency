The area was part of the Inca Empire until the city was founded by the Spanish Francisco Pizarro in 1535 as the capital of the new Spanish empire.</p><p>You will visit Huaca Pucllana, an adobe and clay pyramid built around 500 A.D. before taking in the colonial buildings of the historic centre.

You will visit the complex of Koricancha, which contained the Temple of the Sun, the most sacred site in the Inca religion. It was the centrepiece of a vast astronomical observatory. Little remains of it today except for sections of its stone walls which hint at the sites once massive size. The Christian monastery of Santo Domingo was built on top of the complex, no doubt to signify that one religion had been replaced by another.</p><p>Afterwards, you will drive to the nearby ruins of Sacsayhuaman which reveal the Incas extraordinary architecture. Like all Inca constructions, the stones fit together perfectly without mortar and it would be hard to fit a single sheet of paper even between the biggest. It took almost one hundred years and thousands of men to complete. Next you visit a site shrouded in mystery, the large rock and intricate complex of Qenko. The site is named for the zigzag channels carved into the rock which are believed to have been used by Inca priests to pour sacred chicha or llama blood into as part of an annual ritual.</p><p>Next you explore the archeological site of Tambomachay, which is thought to be a site used to worship water as the source of life. Two aqueducts, artistically carved on the rock, transport and keep a constant flow of clean water. Your final stop is the red fortress of Puka Pukara which took its name from the colour of the stones (especially at dusk).</p><p>You will then be transferred back to your hotel and will have the remainder of the day free to explore and enjoy one of the many quaint restaurants in the historical centre.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
