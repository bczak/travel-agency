Nowhere is Mexico’s
past better depicted than at its central plaza, the Zocalo. Surrounded by some of the finest buildings of the colonial era, are the remnants of one of the Aztecs’ principal monuments, the Templo Mayor. Its mysterious shapes stand as a haunting tribute to the pre-Hispanic civilisation that flourished here long ago.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

You will explore the “Zocalo”, also known as the Plaza de la Constitucion. This has been the heart of the city since the Aztec’s rule at the time of Montezuma I and was surrounded by palaces and temples. It is now the  a good understanding of Mexico’s history and culture
in this square alone, from the ruins of the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan to Diego Riviera’s murals of the struggle for independence on the walls of the National Palace</p><p>That afternoon you will visit the historical archeological complex of Teotihuacan. You will take in the fascinating Pyramid of the Sun and the Moon and Calle de los Muertos (Street of the Dead) which was once flanked by palaces, temples and platforms. The buildings are decorated with friezes and other ornate artworks. Be
prepared for lots of walking and climbing here. If at all possible, we would recommend climbing to the top of the Sun and then at least to the first platform of the Moon for the amazing view down the Calle de los Muertos. Bearing the above in mind, bring some water as the refreshment stalls are quite a distance from the pyramids, a sunhat and camera but little else to carry around.</p><p>Today you will also visit the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Approximately five miles north-east of the Zocalo is the Basilica de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, home of the most venerated icon in Mexico. It is said that the image of the Virgin was imprinted on the cloak of Juan Diego, an ordinary Indian who was chosen by the bishop of Tlatelolco to build a church on the hill. The famous cloak now hangs in a new basilica built alongside the old, which is tilting severely as it sinks into the soft soil.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

It is flanked by four of Mexico’s best-known volcanoes — Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl, Malinche and  Citlaltepetl, also known as Pico de Orizaba. There are many reasons to visit the city, including sampling its fabulous regional cuisine. Some of Puebla’s delectable dishes include their famous mole
poblana sauce as well as the seasonal delicious dish of chiles en nogada. The historic centre of Puebla has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for this honour is due to the absolutely stunning tile work that decorates the town’s historic colonial buildings. Famous for the handpainted Talavera tile, Puebla was the first city in New Spain to master the art of decorating and glazing firebaked clay, an art introduced by the Spanish, which had Arabic influences. Spanish tile makers took up residence in Puebla and set a standard of excellence that prevails to this day. You will see tiles adorning many churches and other buildings around the town.</p><p>Once you have spent the day soaking up the charms of Puebla, you will continue on to your hotel in Oaxaca where the evening is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
