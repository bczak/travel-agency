You are free to arrive today at your leisure. In order to fully enjoy the optional excursions available in La Paz we highly recommend booking pre tour accommodation.</p><p>La Paz is unlike any other city in the world. A dizzying blend of sounds, colours, smells, bustling activity and true Bolivian culture, La Paz is also the highest capital city in the world, sitting at an impressive 3,500 metres above sea level. Surrounded by the snow capped Altiplano mountains, the city is crammed into a canyon and surrounded by eroding and unique rock formations.</p><p>Built in a steep valley that protects the city from the harsh elements of the Altiplano, just about every building in La Paz is built on some sort of hill, so sightseeing will literally take your breath away! Our hotel is very centrally located and is just around the corner from the city's colourful indigenous street markets including the fascinating and suitably named "Witches Market'' where local women in traditional 'Cholita' dress sell such items as dead cats and llamas foetuses said to ward off evil spirits. The main square, Plaza Murillo, is also within walking distance. The square still retains its colonial buildings including the Presidential Palace. La Paz is possibly the best place to experience a traditional peña show of Andean music and dance to local bands playing time-honoured instruments such as zampoñas (pipes) and charangos (the ukulele).</p><p>You will have a pre departure meeting at 6pm tonight to meet your tour leader and fellow travellers. Please check the reception of the hotel for details.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Sagarnaga or similar .

If it is a clear day, you will be able to see the huge expanse of the Altiplano as you fly over the landlocked country, perhaps seeing the Andes slowly flattening out to become the Amazonian basin, which spreads to the far East of the country, to the border with Brazil.</p><p>Arriving in the early evening you will have time to relax before the exciting 4WD tour to the Salar de Uyuni tomorrow.</p><p>Please note: During the winter months of May-August temperatures of the Altiplano can be extremely cold, so please be prepared and pack warm clothes</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Toñito Hotel or similar .

First on the agenda is a visit to the Train Cemetery, where you can see the remains of 19th and early 20th century steam locomotives - a good place for artistic photographs. We will then come to Colchani, the main plant for the iodisation of salt and the best place to observe the methods of salt extraction from the salar. Here ovens are used to dry the salt, which is then formed into cakes. From here we drive onto the Salt Flats themselves. Claimed to be the largest salt flat in the world, the brilliant white vast Salar de Uyuní, which covers some 10,500 square kilometres and is estimated to contain 10 billion tons of salt, looks like something from a surrealist painting and its seemingly infinite horizons will amaze you. You will then visit either Fish Island or Incahuasi Island (seasonal dependent). Located in the centre of the Salar, 100 kilometres from Uyuní, this hilly outpost is covered in giant cacti amid a flat, white sea of hexagonal salt tiles.The otherworldly views from the islands will take your breath away, with the brilliant blue sky (weather permitting of course) contrasting with the pure white of the salt flats.</p><p>Please Note: Occasionally in the rainy season the salt flats become overly flooded and we may have to alter the itinerary if the salt flats are not safe to traverse. Your tour leader will advise as early as possible if this is likely to happen on your tour.</p><p>Please Note:The accommodation here is basic with limited facilities. Please see your tour notes for further details.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hostels (basic multi-share hostel) or similar .

You will see a variety of dramatic landscapes including smoking volcanoes, barren deserts and gravity-defying rock formations carved by the wind. In this incredibly empty landscape you'll most likely feel the furthest from civilisation you've ever been. You will visit  a number of lagoons including Cañapa, Chairkota and Laguna Honda. You will also get to see the Laguna Colorada, which offers some truly breathtaking scenery, with several varieties of flamingos gathering in the shallow waters of the beautiful crimson lagoon. Before arriving at Laguna Colorada you will pass Arbol de Piedra, the famous Stone Tree.</p><p>Please Note:The temperatures can get very cold and often drop below zero when crossing the Bolivian Altiplano, especially the winter months from May to September. You may wish to bring a sleeping bag if traveling in the winter months. A sleeping bag can also be rented from your Tour Leader for 70 Bolivian Bolivianos. Also note that on occasion in winter snow can cause the itinerary to be altered at short notice.</p><p>Please Note:The accommodation here is basic with limited facilities. Please see your tour notes for further details.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hostels (basic multi-share hostel) or similar .

We make our way to San Pedro de Atacama, making a few stops on the way. We visit the volcanic zone ‘Sol de Mañana' (Morning Sun) at 4,850 metres above sea level. Here you'll discover a geyser basin with bubbling mud pots, hellish fumaroles and a thick aroma of sulphur fumes. Inside a small crater we will observe mud bubbling away and we will also stop at hot springs where you can bathe. We will pass the Desert of Salvador Dali before crossing a 5,000 metre pass. We then come to the beautiful Laguna Verde, which is shadowed by the cone of the Licancabur Volcano. Next to Laguna Verde is Laguna Blanca, known as the White Lake. Continuing on we will cross into Chile. On the way we get the chance to see both the Bolivian and Chilean sides of the 5960m Licancabur Volcano.</p><p>We then come to San Pedro de Atacama in the world's driest desert. The area is famous for the salt-covered lunar landscapes, geysers, salt flats and hot springs of the Valley of the Moon, which we will explore by van tomorrow.</p><p> Please Note: Upon exiting Bolivia you will be required to pay a small fee of 20 Bolivianos.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Don Raul or similar .

Due to its remote location and dry climate, the Atacama desert offers some of the clearest skies in the world and as such is used by international space agencies to monitor the skies. If you are lucky enough to have clear nights during your stay in San Pedro de Atacama, the starscape will most likely be the best you'll ever see.</p><p>Today we enjoy an excursion to the Valley of the Moon. The various stone formations have been formed by the wind and rain over time, resulting in unique and interesting shapes, similar to the surface of the moon. In fact, it is said a prototype of the Mars rover was tested in the area!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Don Raul or similar .

It is well-known for its fresh markets such as the famous La Vega Central Market, and the Mercado Central, one of the best seafood markets in the world. You can see the changing of the guard most days outside the impressive Palacio de La Moneda, the seat of the President of Chile. In the 1970s, the palace was bombarded during the military coup d'état, ushering in a dark period in Chile’s national history.</p><p>Other interesting places to visit are the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, an impressive fine art gallery housed in a colossal neo-classical building, and the Cementerio General, a huge cemetery with large mausoleums including that of the former president Salvador Allende Gossens. Also worth a visit is the Plaza de Armas, the centrepiece of the city, which is bordered on one side by the impressive Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago, completed in the 19th century.</p><p>For the best views of the city, take a funicular railway or hike to the top of San Cristobal, where the Statue of the Virgin overlooks the capital and the distant Andes. Here you can taste some of Chile's best wines and find some beautifully situated swimming pools.</p><p>You may wish to take an optional excursion to the Chilean coast, about two hours’ drive from Santiago. You can wander around the creative port city of Valparaiso, which has a lively tradition of imaginative street art and painted murals, or you can relax in the upmarket beach resort of Viña del Mar, trying exquisite seafood in stylish restaurants that look out onto the Pacific Ocean.</p><p> Please Note: On the morning we depart to Santiago breakfast is not included, as we depart early to maximise our time in Santiago.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Libertador or similar .

your tour in La Paz</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Hotel Sagarnaga<br /> Calle Sag&amp;aacute;rnaga no. 326 - 328<br /> Zona Rosario<br /> La Paz</p>
<p>Tel: (+591) 2 235 0252 / 231 0893<br /> www.hotel-sagarnaga.com</p>
<p>The hotel has safe deposit boxes for your use (you will get an itemised receipt). Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you.</p>
<p>It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major South American cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in La Paz</h5>
<p>At over 3,600 metres above sea level La Paz is one of the highest cities on Earth and you may feel the effects of altitude, which affects all people differently.&amp;nbsp;If you have just arrived it is suggested you take it very easy for the first day and follow the recommendations below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drink plenty of water, around two to two-and-a-half litres per day. Bottled water is available everywhere.</li>
<li>The affects of alcohol and cigarettes are made considerably worse by the thin air. Try to avoid these in excess for the first few days.</li>
<li>Take it easy. Walk slowly and avoid sudden movements</li>
</ul>
<p>When arriving at El Alto International Airport in La Paz we suggest that you change some money into the local currency at the exchange office (&amp;ldquo;Cambio&amp;rdquo;) in the main terminal building. The local currency is the boliviano. Change enough money to see you through the first few days of your trip &amp;ndash; particularly if it is a weekend. Please note you can only change cash (not traveller&amp;rsquo;s cheques) at the Cambio in the airport. There are also ATMs at the airport.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you decide not to pre-book an arrival transfer, you will find a 24 hour taxi rank outside the airport (all the taxis are white). You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have too much of a problem getting a taxi as they all wait in an orderly line outside the terminal and are fairly safe to use. The cost of a taxi from the airport to our hotels in La Paz should be approximately 50-80 bolivianos (US$7-10). Taxi drivers do have a tendency to switch their lights off at night (to save the battery!) so if they do this, insist that they switch the lights back on. To get to the hotel, the taxis will have to drive through the sprawling city of El Alto, which can be an interesting experience. Make sure you lock the taxi doors, as theft can be a problem in La Paz and El Alto. The drive into the city however has spectacular views.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a great variety of accommodation, providing you with unique experiences to last a lifetime! You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<p><strong>Uyuni Salt Flats</strong> - You will spend one night in a traditional local hostel made from salt blocks. The rooms are multi-share with up to 4 people per room with communal bathrooms and showers. There is limited hot water and towels are not normally provided so you should ensure you bring your own. We highly recommend taking a sleeping bag as it can get incredibly cold at high altitude at night. Unless you have rented one for the Inca Trail, you will already have one for this. It is essential to have warm clothes. The lighting and power are on for limited hours and there are communal charging stations available. Accommodation in the salt flats in sparse and the area is very under-developed, meaning there is no light pollution. While the facilities here are basic, standing under the clear night sky is a wonderful experience!</p>
<p><strong>Laguna Colorada National Park</strong> - In Laguna Colorada National Park you will stay in a local hostel with multi-share rooms with up to 7 people per room. There are communal bathrooms however there is no hot water and no showers. There is also no heating and so it can be very cold in winter and again warm clothes are essential. There are no power outlets or charging stations so ensure all your electronics are fully charged and it&amp;rsquo;s also recommended to take a portable charger with you.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. The only locations where you will be in multi-share dorms are Uyuni Salt Flats and Laguna Colorada National Park.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans.

<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses three different currencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bolivian Boliviano</li>
<li>Chilean Peso</li>
<li>Argentinian Peso</li>
</ul>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is part of life in South America. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Free Walking Tours</h5>
<p>Free walking tours are found in many of the large cities. These are marketed as free walking tours and are designed to provide travellers with local, in depth knowledge of the city. However all free walking tours are tip based (they have to make money somehow, after all!) and so if you wish to join a free walking tour you need to budget in a tip at the end. Leaving a free walking tour that was considered a good tour without tipping is very disrespectful and will only give travellers a bad reputation.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of Asian cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p>
<p>Overall the food scene in South America is incredible and you will get to experience everything from local lunches in rural areas to high end restaurants in the bigger cities. The markets in Cusco and the Central Market in Santiago are especially good to pick up some local treats. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>South America has some amazing markets selling delicious food. Eating at local markets is a great way to experience authentic food and at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in South America</h5>
<p>South America is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Altitude Sickness</h5>
<p>All clients warrant and accept that there is a chance they may get some form of altitude sickness on itineraries that generally travel to altitudes over 2,400 metres though Tucan Travel will not expose clients to any undue risk of altitude sickness. Tucan Travel tour leaders, staff and local suppliers working at higher altitudes will have some level of knowledge and / or training on how to help and advise you. Please read the information contained <a href="high-altitude-sickness">here</a> to ensure you understand the risks and what to do in this event.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip.
