We stay close to Chobe National Park which is home to the most diverse wildlife in Botswana. 11,000 square kilometres of wilderness, floodplains, forests and swamps support all manners of animal and birdlife. To gain a different perspective of the animals we embark on a sunset cruise along the Chobe River. Wildlife is plentiful and common along the water’s edge; as we glide by you may see elephants, buffalos, kudu, bushback, hippo, giraffe and sable.</p><p>Located in north west Botswana, Chobe is a diverse area spanning from the border at the Chobe River, to the now dry Savute Channel and beyond to the borders of the Moremi Game Reserve and Okavango Delta. The park is divided into four distinctly different eco systems: Serondela with its lush plains and dense forests in the Chobe River area, the Savuti Marsh, the Linyanti Swamps and the dry hinterland and it is famous for having one of the largest game concentrations in the African continent.</p><p>Please note: You will be required to pay a Tourism Levy of U$30 when entering Botswana. This is payable by cash or credit card.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Thebe River Safari Lodge or similar .

You will be staying at Elephant Sands, a bush lodge set on private conservancy in the north-east part of Botswana. It is home to a huge amount of wildlife that roams free, especially elephants. You can enjoy the swimming pool and if you are lucky catch a sighting of one of these gentle giants! Elephant Sands is located near two waterholes which are only a few feet away.</p><p>You will be staying in stilted tented camps and can enjoy a cocktail or two in the Elephant Sands bar.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in tented camps at Elephant Sands or similar .

The water fans out from the river into a labyrinth of channels, lagoons and palm-covered islands before evaporating over the sands of the Kalahari Desert.</p><p>Today we will take a day trip to the small islands in the bush.  We will travel by hand-crafted mokoros (small boats with shallow drafts similar to canoes) through the delta. The canoes glide silently along the reed-fringed waterways, steered by stealthy polers who earn their living transporting travellers along the delta. We will also have walking safaris through the bush and a chance for a swim before returning to the hotel in Maun.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Sedia Hotel or similar .

Keep your camera lens ready for rare antelope species, the Burchell's zebra and black-faced impala's which roam the wild savannah. You may spot the odd giraffe or two chewing through thorny acacia trees in the woodland areas. Etosha National Park is a bird watcher's paradise with some 340 species inhabiting the park at different times of the year. For a short period after seasonal rains Etosha's vast salt pan is covered by a layer of water which attracts massive flocks of pelicans, flamingoes and other wading birds. While the pan is dry it is notable for the way it dramatically changes colour during the early morning and late afternoon sun.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in lodges .

It is Namibia's most popular holiday destination. We spend two nights here, so you can wander around town viewing the colonial architecture or perhaps enjoy a cold locally brewed beer or two. If you would prefer to fuel your thirst for adrenaline then there is a wide range of optional excursions available. The town also has a good selection of bars and restaurants to cater for every taste. The seafood here is great!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Dunedin Star Guesthouse or similar .

At an elevation of 1650 metres, Windhoek lies in a beautiful valley and is surrounded by the Eros Mountains in the north and the Auas mountains to the south. This is the only city in Namibia and is home to a population of over 250,000 inhabitants.</p><p>Like in Swakopmund there is a noticeable German influence here. German is still widely spoken and it is common to find traditional breads, sausage, and other delicacies, they even hold annual beer festivals.</p><p>No tourists visit to Windhoek is complete without paying a visit to Joe’s Beer house, a bar and restaurant providing a mix of warm Namibian and German hospitality. This place is full of old relics from ‘Joe’s’ travels and creates a great atmosphere for socialising and reminiscing about your journey so far. Here you can also opt to sample some delicious game meats or try out one of the many craft beers on offer.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Roof of Africa Hotel or similar .

your tour in Livingstone</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Fawlty Towers Hotel<br /> 216 Mosi O Tunya Road<br />Livingstone<br />Zambia</p>
<p>Tel: +260 213 323 432</p>
<h5>Arriving in Livingstone</h5>
<p>When arriving at Livingstone International Airport it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to obtain some local currency, the Zambian kwacha. There are a number of ATMs and several banks inside the new arrival terminal. If the ATMs are down and the banks are closed then we would recommend that you pay for your taxi with US dollars cash and obtain some Kwacha from the travel centre at the joining hotel or from one of the bureaus in town if you are not staying at the joining hotel. Mo Money or next door at the FX on the main road in town normally give the better rates and please remember do not change money on the street. ATMs are also found in town at the Standard Charter and Barclays banks.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p><strong>Tucan Travel Transfers :</strong> Private airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<p><strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong></p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel, an official taxi from the airport to the joining hotel will cost approximately US$20 to US$25 per taxi, carrying a maximum of four people.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>One of the exciting elements of travelling in Africa, is the different styles of accommodation stayed in whilst on tour. You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites.</p>
<h5>Important notes on African Accommodation</h5>
<p>Travelling in Africa is about the experience. Many of the countries we travel through are still developing and therefore accommodation is likely to differ to what you may be used to. In remote locations, many lodges and camps rely on generators for electricity and power shortages are not uncommon. All of the accommodation we use includes bedding and real beds - so you do not need to bring a sleeping bag at any point of this tour. Please note, that some accommodation includes a shared bathroom and shower facilities. WI-FI is available in most locations however it can be very unreliable, especially in the national parks. Expect to be offline for a few days and if you are able to connect - it's a bonus!</p>
<p><strong>Permanent Tents</strong> - This tour includes stays in permanent tents which will be equipped with beds and mosquito nets. In some locations the tents will have an en-suite bathroom whilst others have a shared bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Rondavels</strong> - Rondavels are round, African-style huts which make for wonderfully unique accommodation. They have real beds and basins in the huts, however toilets and showers are shared in near-by abolition blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Lodges</strong> - Lodges will vary depending on the location.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless. If you are a solo passenger you will be sharing a room with another group member of the same sex. If you are travelling with a partner and wish to book a double bed, please advice your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of private vehicles and the Tucan Travel Overland Truck. You can read more about them <a href="overland-holidays">here</a>. The overland truck is a Mercedes-Benz custom built for us! Each is named after a past Tucan Travel colleague and they are some of the biggest and brightest overland vehicles on the road. Each truck tackles tough Africa terrain in its stride, and towers above the ground. They are equipped with big windows to open - perfect for wildlife spotting on game drives in Kruger National Park.</p>
<p>The truck is equipped with the following features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mostly forward-facing seats &amp;amp; seat belts</li>
<li>Water tanks &amp;amp; storage for bulk supplies</li>

</ul>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport. Please limit yourself to one piece of luggage per person plus one smaller day bag.</p>
<h5>Approximate travel times on this trip</h5>
<p>The below information provides approximate travel times and modes of transport for your tour. Please note that modes of transport may be subject to change depending on the group size and timings may vary depending on the season and border crossings on the day. This is especially apt for Africa and we like to think it's all part of the adventure!</p>

</description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>Below are the currencies which are used on this tour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zambian kwacha</li>
<li>Botswana pula</li>
<li>Namibian dollar</li>
</ul>
<p>As you travel through Africa you will be able to exchange either USD or other African currencies so you do not need to bring local currency for each destination before the tour.</p>
<p>Most optional excursions are listed in US dollar. While many of the more expensive excursions, such as hot air ballooning, can be paid in USD you will need local currency for most excursions.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in larger cities will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card. In more remote locations, you should always ensure you have a supply of cash.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. On long travel days, lunch will sometimes be served by your tour leader from the truck. Details of this can be found in the itinerary. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is generally a part of life in Africa. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p>

</description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>Please consider which season you are travelling in and pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer. Colours are important if you are embarking on a safari drive. Opt for muted colours that will blend into the bush - such as browns, khaki and beige. Remember that the roads are dusty and you're clothing might get dirty so don't take expensive items.</p>
<p>What essential items should I bring to Africa?</p>
<ul>
<li>A lightweight and waterproof jacket.</li>
<li>Good, comfortable walking shoes are essential. There can either be comfortable trainers or walking shoes.</li>
<li>A small daypack - This should have enough room to carry food and snacks for long hikes and treks and space to carry belongings.</li>
<li>Layers- We recommend packing lightweight and durable clothes. On the Gorilla Trek you will need to wear long trousers and sleeves to protect yourself within the jungle.</li>
<li>Sun protection- It can get very hot in Africa, especially on days with walking safaris out in the African sun. Ensure you have a sun hat and sunscreen to keep you safe.</li>
<li>Insect Repellent (DEET 35% min) and bite cream - Malaria is rife in Africa. As well as taking malaria tablets, ensure you are protecting bites with insect repellent.</li>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included and lunch and dinner may be included on long travel days. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of African cities, there is a decent choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to meeting your tour please call (+44) 788 7498 617.</p>
<h5>Safety in Africa</h5>
<p>Africa is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. You may need several vaccinations and/or malaria tablets and you should be aware that some vaccinations require more than one visit and can take several weeks to administer. Always carry your International Certificate of Vaccination with your passport. For areas with malaria, make sure you pack sufficient prophylactics for the duration of your tour and the incubation period after. Most countries in Africa prevent entry for travellers without a valid Yellow Fever certificate. This must be acquired before departure and takes ten days for your body to build up a resistance. This certificate must be taken with you on your tour with a photocopy stored somewhere safe.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.

<p>A yellow fever vaccination is required if you are travelling to/from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission in Africa; this includes transiting through a yellow fever risk country.
