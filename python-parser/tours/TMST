While the ruins were only discovered by the outside world in 1911, the site was never really lost and has been continually used for farming by the local people. Located high above the fast flowing Urubamba River, the cloud shrouded ruins have palaces, baths, temples, storage rooms and some 150 houses, all so remarkably preserved that it will take your breath away.</p><p>As you will have return bus tickets, you can make your own way down to Aguas Calientes in time for your train back to Cusco where you will be collected on arrival and taken back to your hotel by private vehicle. The evening is then at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
