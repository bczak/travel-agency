In 1736, a French scientific expedition travelled to Ecuador to try and determine the position of the Equator. This mission was called the French Geodesic Mission and in 1935 the government built the ten metre high monument to honour this expedition. The monument was then replaced in 1972 to what now stands at thirty metres and is titled &amp;#34;Ciudad Mitad del Mundo&amp;#34;.</p><p>On the site, there is a monument which houses an Ethnographic Museum. Here you will learn about lifestyles, clothing and utensils of the different ethnic groups of Ecuador. Just outside Mitad del Mundo, there is an interesting open-air museum known as &amp;#34;Inti&amp;#45;&amp;#209;an&amp;#34;, which explains our solar system, the position of the equator and its effect on gravity. There is also interesting displays of Ecuadorian ancient cultures and their ways of life.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
