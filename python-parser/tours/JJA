As you discover the city you will find there is no actual centre to Tokyo but a collection of impressive districts, all full of attractions. Shinjuku is the main cosmopolitan entertainment quarter for restaurants, shopping and Japans busiest rail station. Here huge plasma screens blast out bright, neon advertisements, while side streets house strip clubs and smoky jazz bars. A quieter option is to spend time in Ueno (Koen) Park where you can visit the Tokyo Zoological Gardens, National Museums, wander among the cherry trees and the see the historical Toshogu Shrine.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

There are other options you can do here such as boat on the lake with a stunning view of Mt Fuji, or take the rope way up the surrounding mountain for an equally impressive view, or take a bus out to Mt Fuji (depending on the time of the season) and although you won't be able to climb, you can still marvel at its presence.</p><p>Mount Fuji (Fujisan) is Japan's highest mountain at 3776 metres and can be seen from Tokyo and Yokohama on clear days. This dormant volcano, which last erupted in 1708, has long been worshipped as a sacred mountain and has always experienced huge popularity.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Takayama is located in the mountainous Hida region of Gifu Prefecture, which has retained a traditional feel unlike many other Japanese cities, especially in its beautifully preserved Old Town. The southern half of the Old Town, especially the Sannomachi Street, is particularly pretty with many old homes, shops, coffee houses and sake breweries, some of which have been in business for centuries. After our bike ride is over you can lose yourself in the back streets or venture out of town if you're feeling adventurous.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

It boasts some two thousand mind-blowing temples, shrines, castles and palaces, making it one of the world's most visited cities. Some of these include the Golden &amp; Silver Pavilions, the Kiyomizu Dera, the Ryoan-Ji and Nijo Castle, where the Shoguns used to stay whilst visiting the city.  It is also home to the Imperial Palace that has recently become much easier to visit.  You can also explore the Bamboo Forest and the Fushimi Inari shrine where many movie scenes have been shot, including Memoirs of a Geisha. Close to the city's famous Toji temple is an impressive 57 metre high Buddhist pagoda dating back to 794AD, the year the city was established as the Imperial Capital. Right next door, the monthly Kobo-san flea market offers a bargain hunter's paradise, where you can rummage through a range of items from second hand kimonos to war memorabilia, food and sculptures.</p><p>If you are interested in Japanese cultural history, you may like to visit the Kamo Shrines, called the Shimogamo Shrine and Kamigamo Shrine, which are both recognised as UNESCO World Heritage Sites and are among the most important in Japan. Predating even the Toji temple, these shrines were traditionally visited by members of the Imperial court, who would worship Shinto gods called Kami, and ask them to protect the city and help it to prosper. The Shimogamo Shrine is surrounded by the Tadasu no Mori forest, which features trees that are up to 600 years old, while the nearby Kamigamo Shrine is known for sand cones at its entrance, which have been built and rebuilt since ancient times to help purify and protect the shrine.</p><p>We will take a tour of the Geisha District. Keep an eye out for Gion Square where some scenes from the movie 'Memoirs of a Geisha' were filmed. If you haven't read the book it's a great insight into traditional Japanese life and the effects of the war on society. It may also be possible to see a geisha dance performance or tea ceremony demonstration.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Known as the 'White Heron' castle because of its brilliant white exterior, the castle features more than 80 buildings, and an intricately designed series of paths within the fortified complex which are designed to confuse any potential invaders. An optional guide can be hired or you are free to explore on foot yourself.</p><p>We then head to Hiroshima, the first city in history to be hit by an atomic bomb, and as a result is now dedicated to promoting peace. Your tour leader will take you to The Peace Memorial Park which was built to promote a peaceful world. Here you will see where the bomb hit on August 6, 1945 at approximately 8:15 am. You will also have a chance to visit the outstanding but chilling museum with real images, video footage, various surviving objects, and true accounts left by the survivors. The Atomic Bomb Dome is one of the few buildings around the explosion's epicentre that partially survived the blast and the city's only remaining bomb damaged building. The former Industrial Promotion Hall is now an UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Passing underneath a torii gate on the way to visit a shrine is an act of sanctification and purification. The floating torii can be accessed only when the tide is out. It is common practice for visitors to place coins in the cracks of the legs of the gate and make a wish. As the island is considered a sacred place, the maple trees which cover the island cannot be cut down and deer and monkeys roam freely.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Nagasaki is an attractive port city on the island of Kyushu and the capital of Nagasaki Prefecture. Nagasaki has played a prominent role in foreign trade relations for many centuries and as a result it became the second city after Hiroshima to be targeted and destroyed by an atomic bomb towards the end of World War II. Your Tour Leader will take you on a tour to the memorial park site which is dedicated to the dark day of August 9, 1945 when the bomb struck and destroyed vast parts of the city, killing tens of thousands of people. There is also a Peace Statue and other memorials such as a black pillar which marks the atomic explosion's epicentre in the nearby Hypocenter Park.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

your tour in Tokyo</name><description><p>Your joining hotel is finalised one month before your departure date.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your Tucan Travel tour leader will usually arrive at the hotel the day before your tour begins. although he/she will be in and out of the hotel making the necessary tour arrangements he/she will have arranged a pre-departure meeting with the group, usually at 6pm on the tour start day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please note that Japanese hotels do not usually allow for early check-in. Therefore if you arrive early on the tour start day then you may have to wait to check-in</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; color: #3c4043; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></p>
<h5>Arriving in Tokyo</h5>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-b7c9ab30-7fff-a96e-442e-cef598a6ddae">When arriving at either of Tokyo's two international airports, Haneda or Narita, </span>we recommend that you obtain some Japanese yen as soon as you arrive. There are international ATMs inside the airport, as well as money exchange offices offering a good rate. The rate will always vary slightly depending on where you go, it may be worth changing a small amount of money at the airport for your transport, and then finding a bank or money exchange within the city centre.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p><strong>From Haneda Airport</strong><br /> There are several options that will take you from Haneda Airport in to the city.</p>
<p>Tokyo Monorail<strong><br /> </strong>The monorail goes from Haneda to Hamamatsucho Station (which is on the JR Yamanote line). Some of the monorail trains are express and it is possible to get from Haneda to Hamamatsucho station in about 14 minutes. You can buy a ticket for 630 yen which will cover one way travel on the monorail train to Hamamatsucho station.</p>
<p>Limousine Bus<br /> You can take a Limousine bus to Tokyo station. It costs 900 yen and takes around an hour.</p>
<p><strong>From Narita Airport</strong><br /> There are several options to travel from Narita Airport to Tokyo.</p>
<p>Trains<strong><br /> </strong>The quickest way to get in to the city is the Skyliner which operates every 30-40 minutes between both Airport Terminals and stops only at Nippori on its way to Keisei Ueno Station. The journey takes approximately an hour and costs about&amp;nbsp;2400 yen (US$16). Tickets can be bought from the Keisei ticket counters in terminals 1 or 2 after clearing customs. Trains depart from the basement level.</p>
<p>Alternatively there is the Narita Express which arrives at Tokyo Station and costs 2940 yen.</p>
<p>Limousine Bus<br /> This service stops at major hotels in the city and costs &amp;yen;2700 to &amp;nbsp;Asakusa. The ticket can be purchased at the ticket counter in Narita Airport. The journey takes between an hour to an hour and a half.</p>
<h3>Pre-Departure Meeting</h3>
<p>When you arrive on day one of your trip, you should find some local information at the hotel lobby. Your tour leader will be staying in the hotel and should have put up a welcome note to let you know what room they are in. A pre-departure meeting is usually held in the afternoon or early evening of day one. You will need to bring the following important items to the meeting with your tour leader:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your passport, including any necessary visas and at least one photocopy to give to your tour leader</li>
<li>Vaccination certificates if relevant to any destinations on your tour</li>
<li>Travel insurance policy and a photocopy to give to your tour leader</li>
<li>Your travel voucher</li>
</ul>
<h5>Missing the tour departure</h5>
<p>If you miss the start of your tour, please ask at the reception of the hotel for a message from your tour leader which will give you instructions on how to catch up with the group. Any associated costs will be at your own expense (although, depending on the reason, you may be able to claim these from your travel insurance so ensure you keep all receipts).</p>
<p>If you know in advance that you are unlikely to arrive on time, please contact Tucan Travel immediately so we can inform the tour leader. Tucan Travel cannot be held responsible should your airline/boat/coach be delayed and we are unable to refund any unused portion of your tour.</p>
<h5>Time Keeping</h5>
<p>Punctuality is very important and throughout the tour your Tour Leader will give you the time to meet in reception. Tour Leaders will often post notes at reception with meeting times, so remember to always look out for these.</p>
<p>Although rare, delays can occur and we therefore advise you not to arrange your onward travel too close to the end of the tour. We take no responsibility for any missed flights or additional expenses If the group arrives late into the departure city at the end of the tour.</p>
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>Your tour in Japan will use tourist class hotels.</p>
<p>We use a mixture of hotel styles in Japan depending on location and availability.  You will find out your joining hotel one month before departure on your joining vouchers. The hotels used are centrally located with easy access to trains and buses. You may find that the hotel rooms in Japan tend to err on the smaller side and the pillows can be quite flat.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room.</p>
<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on most occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p> 
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>The main transport used on this tour in the Shinkansen, also known as the Bullet Train. It is by far the fastest way to travel through Japan and is an experience in itself!</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport.</p>
<p>Your tour includes the Japan Rail pass, which covers all Shinkansen journeys as well local trains and JR lines in Tokyo used whilst on tour. In some of the cities we will also use public buses to get to included excursions as well as some taxis to help us get to our hotels.</p>
<p>This tour also includes a day trip to Miyajima Island where you will take a short ferry journey.</p>
<h5>Approximate travel times on this trip</h5>
<p>The below information provides approximate travel times and modes of transport for your tour. Please note that modes of transport may be subject to change depending on the group size and timings may vary depending on the season and border crossings on the day.</p>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>Japan uses the Japanese Yen which can be exchanged beforehand in your own country or taken out and exchanged at Post Offices or 7/11s in Japan.</p>
<p>We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<p>Some optional activities listed on the itinerary are in USD for the ease of global travellers; however, you will need to ensure you bring the appropriate currency when travelling.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>Japan is actually a country where cash is very much preferred. In many restaurants and shops you will find that you cannot pay with card so please ensure you are carrying cash at all times. It is easy to find ATMs - most 7-11 shops will have them. For restaurants that do accept card, Visa and Mastercard are preferred - you may find some places will not accept American Express.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. Japan can be known as a pricey destination and yes this can be the case with some restaurants especially in Tokyo, but you will always be able to find food to suit your budget. Keep an eye out for lunch deals and set menus.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Japan is very much a non-tipping culture and tips can actually be refused. The Japanese are an extremely polite and respectful culture and believe that good service should not be paid extra for. Ensure that you are polite in return and learn Arigatou which means thank you!</p>
<p>Tips are appreciated by Tucan Travel tour leaders at the end of your tour and we recommend an average of $2-$5 per person per day for the duration of your tour. This is only if you feel that their service was up to standard and is completely at your own discretion.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In Japan, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast in Japan will vary depending on the hotel. In some you may find large buffets equipped with everything from cereal to eggs and even noodles and rice which is a staple in most Asian countries. In other hotels there may be a more limited selection available. On this trip, most breakfasts are included. Occasionally a breakfast will be omitted for operational reasons such as early departures when an included breakfast would be missed.</p>
<h5>Vegetarian in Japan</h5>
<p>Finding vegetarian or vegan food in Japan can sometimes be tricky as it is an island nation where seafood is king. Nevertheless many restaurants will have some vegetarian options especially tofu or vegetable rice and noodle based dishes. You can also find a great selection of vegetarian sushi. Your Tour Leader will be able to advise on vegetarian options whilst on tour.</p>
<h5>Food in Japan</h5>

<h5>Safety in Japan</h5>
<p>Japan is generally very safe and has a very low crime rate. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera, Diphtheria and influenza.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.

<p>This tour is modular and gives you the chance to bond with different people as they join and leave in Tokyo, Kyoto and Nagasaki.</p>
<p>This tour uses a mixture of transport including the Shinkansen (Japanese bullet train), taxis, local buses and local trains.</p>
<p>This is a fast paced tour where we will be catching trains at peak hours in busy Japanese train stations which can be very large with time between train changes limited. Therefore the ability to handle one's own luggage whilst walking briskly between trains, often using long staircases is important. The use of elevators with large groups is not possible.</p>
<p>Rooms in the main cities are often quite small which is normal for such a busy island nation.</p>
<p>This tour includes a compulsory Local Payment that needs to be paid to the Tour Leader on Day 1 of your tour. For more information on our Local Payments please click <a href="/our-prices">here</a>.</p></whatYouShouldExpect></tour>
