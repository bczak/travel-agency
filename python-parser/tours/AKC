Kigali is the capital city of Rwanda and the main cultural and commercial hub.</p><p>You are free to arrive today at your leisure - there will be a pre-departure meeting tonight at 6pm so we do ask that you arrive in time for this. Please look out for information on reception.</p><p>Kigali has a turbulent past and was the scene of the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. You will learn more about this tomorrow with a visit to the Genocide Museum and Peacekeepers Memorial. The city has been slowly transforming over the years and now houses delicious restaurants, bars, galleries and parks. Why not explore the Kimironko Market - one of the best for picking up Rwanda agaseke baskets or other unique gifts.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Step Town Hotel or similar .

On route, we make a stop at the Belgian Peacekeepers Memorial and Kigali Genocide Museum to learn about the horrors that occurred in Rwanda between April and July of 1994 and that mass execution of the Tutsi population.. The Belgian Peacekeepers memorial pays tribute to the ten UN workers who were murdered by the Hutu extremists which resulted in the full scale unfolding of the genocide.</p><p>We then cross the border and arrive in Kabale early afternoon, where you have a free afternoon to spend as you wish. Driving into Kabale you will see the unique Ugandan landscape and rolling plantations flash before your eyes where you’ll start to appreciate the underrated beauty of this corner of Africa.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Cephas Inn Hotel or similar .

There are believed to be less than 800 mountain gorillas remaining in the world, and about half of that population live in this forest. To watch them in their natural habitat is a heart-stirring experience.</p><p>Today can be quite a long day so make sure you pack enough water in your day bag to keep hydrated on your trek. To reach the trekking starting point, we will be picked up early in the morning to head for the national park. Expect to trek for up to eight hours today as specialist guides go ahead of you, early in the morning and track the gorilla spoor and look for signs of the gorilla's last movements. The distance you trek is unpredictable and varies depending on how active the gorillas are. Some will not move far from where the trackers left them the day before while others will travel long distances in the search for food.</p><p>Bwindi Impenetrable Forest is a series of rolling hills with heavy foliage and trekking to the gorillas can often involve steep uphill or downhill climbs, sometimes on uneven and wet terrain. Hiking boots are important and you can rent walking sticks at an extra cost to stabilise your feet. The altitude in the forest is varied, with the highest point being 2607m above sea level and 60% of it being over 2000m. With this in mind, you might find hiking through the terrain slightly more difficult than at sea level. Your guides will give you a detailed safety briefing before you depart on the hike and will reiterate key points shortly before getting close to the gorillas.</p><p>Your time with the gorillas is restricted to one hour. This is to safeguard the gorilla families and prevent excessive human contact. You can admire the animals and take photos so make sure your batteries are charged and your memory cards empty. Once your hour is up, you will begin the climb out of the forest. Your guides will take you to the nearest road where a 4WD should be waiting to take you back to camp.</p><p>You can read more about the gorilla trek here.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Cephas Inn Hotel or similar .

There are two slots today, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Depending on the group size, you will be split into various, smaller groups for the excursion. First off, the group will hop on the overland truck and drive for a short twenty minutes to reach the start of the excursion. Meet your local guide and learn about what’s ahead before walking for around 2 to 3 hours to see the cheeky primates. You’ll likely spot a few other animals on route including other primates such as the grey cheeked mangabey or the red tailed monkey. Make sure to be looking up, chimpanzees are almost always moving through the trees. It’s also likely you will hear them before you see them - they are noisy creatures!</p><p>Upon returning to your accommodation, the remainder of the day is free to relax.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a rondavel at Kibale Guest Cottages or similar .

The reserve is known for African buffalo, hippos, African bush elephants, leopards, lions and chimpanzees. Overall, it’s home to 95 mammals and over 500 birds, yet unlike many of Africa’s more known national parks, it’s much less visited and quieter making for a unique experience.</p><p>Upon arrival in the afternoon we enjoy a cruise down the Kazinga Channel. This passage of water connects Lake George and Lake Edward within the reserve and offers a unique perspective of the wondrous surroundings. Keep an eye out for animals lurking both in and out of the water!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in lodges at Irungu Lodge or similar .

Don’t miss a walk through the beautiful and impressive Hell’s Gate Gorge and see why it inspired the stampede scene in Disney’s Lion King.</p><p>You can also visit Elsamere, the former home of the late Joy Adamson, who became famous for her relationship with the lioness Elsa in the film Born Free.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Fish Eagle Inn or similar .

Animals present in the reserve include the big five (lions, elephants, Cape buffaloes, leopards and rhinoceros), various grazing mammals which attract carnivores such as cheetahs, hyenas and jackals, and over 500 recorded species of birds.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in tented camps at AA Masai Mara Lodge or similar .

At any time of year, the river is vitally important to the ecosystem and a good spot to view animals. You will also have the opportunity to visit a local Masai village, learning about the vibrant, semi-nomadic herders’ way of life and join them in a local dance.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in tented camps at AA Masai Mara Lodge or similar .

To gain a different perspective of the animals we embark on a sunset cruise along the Chobe River. Wildlife is plentiful and common along the water’s edge; as we glide by you may see elephants, buffalos, kudu, bushbuck, hippo, giraffe and sable.</p><p>Located in north west Botswana, Chobe is a diverse area spanning from the border at the Chobe River, to the now dry Savute Channel and beyond to the borders of the Moremi Game Reserve and Okavango Delta. The park is divided into four distinctly different eco systems: Serondela with its lush plains and dense forests in the Chobe River area, the Savuti Marsh, the Linyanti Swamps and the dry hinterland and it is famous for having one of the largest game concentrations in the African continent.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Thebe River Safari Lodge or similar .

The water fans out from the river into a labyrinth of channels, lagoons and palm-covered islands before evaporating over the sands of the Kalahari Desert.</p><p>Today we will take a day trip to the small islands in the bush. We will travel by hand-crafted mokoros (small boats with shallow drafts similar to canoes) through the delta. The canoes glide silently along the reed-fringed waterways, steered by stealthy polers who earn their living transporting travellers along the delta. We will also have walking safaris through the bush and a chance for a swim before returning to the hotel in Maun.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Afro Trek Lodge or similar .

Keep your camera lens ready for rare antelope species, the Burchell's zebra and black-faced impala's which roam the wild savannah. You may spot the odd giraffe or two chewing through thorny acacia trees in the woodland areas. Etosha National Park is a bird watcher's paradise with some 340 species inhabiting the park at different times of the year. For a short period after seasonal rains Etosha's vast salt pan is covered by a layer of water which attracts massive flocks of pelicans, flamingoes and other wading birds. While the pan is dry it is notable for the way it dramatically changes colour during the early morning and late afternoon sun.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Etosha Safari Camp or similar .

This is the only city in Namibia and is home to a population of over 250,000 inhabitants. Like in Swakopmund there is a noticeable German influence here. German is still widely spoken and it is common to find traditional breads, sausage, and other delicacies, they even hold annual beer festivals.</p><p>No tourist's visit to Windhoek is complete without paying a visit to Joe’s Beer house, a bar and restaurant providing a mix of warm Namibian and German hospitality. This place is full of old relics from ‘Joe’s’ travels and creates a great atmosphere for socialising and reminiscing about your journey so far. Here you can also opt to sample some delicious game meats or try out one of the many craft beers on offer.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Roof of Africa Hotel or similar .

your tour in Kigali</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Step Town Hotel<br />KN 1 Ave<br />Kigali</p>
<p>Tel: +250 785 005 662&amp;nbsp;<br /> http://step-town.com/</p>
<p>Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out especially in the evening. It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major African cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety. Crime in Africa is not as bad as its reputation but you must be sensible and alert.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>One of the exciting elements of travelling in Africa, is the different styles of accommodation stayed in whilst on tour. You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites.</p>
<h5>Important notes on African Accommodation</h5>
<p>Travelling in Africa is about the experience. Many of the countries we travel through are still developing and therefore accommodation is likely to differ to what you may be used to. In remote locations, many lodges and camps rely on generators for electricity and power shortages are not uncommon. All of the accommodation we use includes bedding and real beds - so you do not need to bring a sleeping bag at any point of this tour. Please note, that some accommodation includes a shared bathroom and shower facilities. WI-FI is available in most locations however it can be very unreliable, especially in the national parks. Expect to be offline for a few days and if you are able to connect - it's a bonus!</p>
<p><strong>Permanent Tents</strong> - This tour includes stays in permanent tents which will be equipped with beds and mosquito nets. In some locations the tents will have an en-suite bathroom whilst others have a shared bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Rondavels</strong> - Rondavels are round, African-style huts which make for wonderfully unique accommodation. They have real beds and basins in the huts, however toilets and showers are shared in near-by abolition blocks.</p>
<p><strong>Lodges</strong> - Lodges will vary depending on the location.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless. If you are a solo passenger you will be sharing a room with another group member of the same sex. If you are travelling with a partner and wish to book a double bed, please advice your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of flights, private vehicles and the Tucan Travel Overland Truck.

</ul></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>Please consider which season you are travelling in and pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer. Colours are important if you are embarking on a safari drive. Opt for muted colours that will blend into the bush - such as browns, khaki and beige. Remember that the roads are dusty and you're clothing might get dirty so don't take expensive items.</p>
<h5>What essential items should I bring to Africa?</h5>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>A lightweight and waterproof jacket.</li>
<li>Good, comfortable walking shoes are essential. There can either be comfortable trainers or walking shoes.</li>
<li>A small daypack - This should have enough room to carry food and snacks for long hikes and treks and space to carry belongings.</li>
<li>Layers- We recommend packing lightweight and durable clothes. On the Gorilla Trek you will need to wear long trousers and sleeves to protect yourself within the jungle.</li>
<li>Sun protection- It can get very hot in Africa, especially on days with walking safaris out in the African sun. Ensure you have a sun hat and sunscreen to keep you safe.</li>
<li>Insect Repellent (DEET 35% min) and bite cream - Malaria is rife in Africa. As well as taking malaria tablets, ensure you are protecting bites with insect repellent.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h5>This trip includes the Gorilla Trek &amp;amp; Chimpanzee Tracking</h5>
<p>Proper walking boots are essential - ideally waterproof with good grip for muddy terrain. You will also need to ensure you have loose, long clothing that covers your arms and legs. You will be walking through the bush and branches/trees may scratch you. Thick socks are also essential so that you can tuck your trousers into them - no one wants fire ants getting in. Ideally, also bring a pair of gardening style gloves so that you can easily grab onto branches. The gorilla trek is undoubtedly one of the most incredible animal encounters in the world and it's important that you are prepared and comfortable so that you can enjoy the activity as much as possible.</p>

<h5>Laundry</h5>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>Below are the currencies which are used on this tour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenyan shilling</li>
<li>Rwandan franc</li>
<li>Ugandan shilling</li>
<li>Tanzanian shilling</li>
<li>Zimbabwean dollar</li>
<li>Botswana pula</li>
<li>Namibian dollar</li>
<li>South African rand</li>
</ul>
<p>As you travel through Africa you will be able to exchange either USD or other African currencies so you do not need to bring local currency for each destination before the tour.</p>
<p>Most optional excursions are listed in US dollar. While many of the more expensive excursions, such as hot air ballooning, can be paid in USD you will need local currency for most excursions.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in larger cities will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card. In more remote locations, you should always ensure you have a supply of cash.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. On long travel days, lunch will sometimes be served by your tour leader from the truck. Details of this can be found in the itinerary. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is generally a part of life in Africa. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included and lunch and dinner may be included on long travel days. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of African cities, there is a decent choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to meeting your tour please call (+263) 77225 2457.</p>
<h5>Safety in Africa</h5>
<p>Africa is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. You may need several vaccinations and/or malaria tablets and you should be aware that some vaccinations require more than one visit and can take several weeks to administer. Always carry your International Certificate of Vaccination with your passport. For areas with malaria, make sure you pack sufficient prophylactics for the duration of your tour and the incubation period after. Most countries in Africa prevent entry for travellers without a valid Yellow Fever certificate. This must be acquired before departure and takes ten days for your body to build up a resistance. This certificate must be taken with you on your tour with a photocopy stored somewhere safe.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible. Please read our comprehensive guide <a href="about-us/responsible-travel/">here</a> before you travel.</p></description></item></tripNotes><whatYouShouldExpect><p>This is a group tour ranging in size from 4 to 19, with an overall average of 10 people. Please read more below for what to expect on a group tour.</p>
<p>You will be travelling onboard our custom-built overland truck for the majority of the trip. Please expect some long travel days and early days as we get from A to B.</p>
<p>This tour includes the Gorilla Trek in Uganda. Please be aware that the gorilla trek can be a very physical hike, in some cases taking up to 8 hours through dense vegetation and steep slopes and sometimes muddy terrain. We therefore advise you to take the option of employing a Porter to help you carry your day-pack, snacks, cameras and other heavy gear, as well as giving you a helping hand during the trek. A porter is hired at the start of your trek for approx. U$20 for the duration of the trek (you are free to add an additional tip should you wish). Employing a porter is a great way of helping the local community &amp;ndash; portering is a source of income for school fees, food, and general support for their families.</p>
<p>We use a mixture of accommodation styles including permanent tents. You will not need to bring a sleeping bag on this tour as all the tents have bedding.</p>
<p>We adopt a #ThisisAfrica approach - go with the flow and appreciate sometimes things differ than what you are used to and you will have the trip of a lifetime!</p>
<p>A yellow fever vaccination is required if you are travelling to/from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission in Africa; this includes transiting through a yellow fever risk country. The majority of our tours in Africa aside from Morocco, require a yellow fever certificate therefore we highly recommend that you obtain this prior to travel. Please make sure that on arrival you have a valid yellow fever certificate ready for inspection by local customs or health authorities, otherwise you could be refused entry or quarantined.</p>
<p>This tour includes a compulsory Local Payment that needs to be paid to the Tour Leader on Day 1 of your tour. For more information on our Local Payments please click <a href="/our-prices">here</a>.</p></whatYouShouldExpect></tour>
