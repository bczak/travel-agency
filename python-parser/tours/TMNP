This bustling metropolis is home to museums, archaeological sites, scenic plazas and an ancient history dating back to early civilisation. On arrival you will be transferred to your hotel to settle in before the adventure begins.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Visit Museo Larco, a private collection, displaying some of  the best Pre-Columbian art in Peru. We will stop in the cafe here to try the Lucuma mousse- a delicious dessert made from the endemic Peruvian fruit. You will get to explore the historic downtown neighbourhood of Lima, a UNESCO site in its own right before continuing  to the Convent of Santo Domingo where you have the chance to climb the tower for breathtaking views of the city. Dating back to the 16th Century, the church and convent itself  is home to the famous statue of ‘La Virgen del Rosario’. Spend some time exploring the back gardens of the church and its beautifully decorated walls before returning to your hotel in afternoon where the evening is free for you to enjoy Lima at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Arguably Peru's best kept secret, Chachapoyas is a remotely located town in the North-western corner of Peru making it the perfect location for scenic hikes and exploring the nearby archaeological sites of the region.</p><p>After our flight, we will be transported via private vehicle to the village of Huancas, which will be our main stop for the day. Located 2558 metres above sea level, the sleepy village of Huancas is mainly known for its production of pottery.</p><p>Feel the true essence and natural beauty of Northern Peru as you take the deep majestic canyons bordering the village such as the Sonche canyon where you can catch spectacular views of the Sonche river from the canyon’s lookout tower. At the bottom the Sonche River is visible and during the rainy season we can also observe several waterfalls.</p><p>After our visit to Huancas we will take the City Café Tour where we will be able to roam the pedestrian-only streets with your guide, learn about the fascinating history of Huancas and get the opportunity to try some of the locally-produced coffee.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

For many, trekking to the iconic Machu Picchu is considered the ultimate must-do activity when visiting Peru, but if you’re a fearless traveller who is always on the lookout for those hidden gems of every country, Kuélap is for you. This fortified monastery and UNESCO nominated site belonging to the Chachapoyas people is three times older than Machu Picchu and is where we will be hopping on to cable cars from the town of Nuevo Tingo to reach.  Kuélap surpasses all expectations for its gigantic building scale with walls that reach up to 20 metres high, forming platforms that house circular structures between houses and temples.</p><p>After the guided tour and lunch, we return to the city of Cachapoyas which is the largest ancient stone-city in Pre-Columbian America.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

These alluring mausoleums are built high into limestone cliffs which you will be able to witness in all its glory as we make our way towards them on a winding drive past surrounding hills and scenic landscapes. To reach the observation point of these impressive tombs is a walk downhill for a period of approximately 1 hour. After some time exploring and learning about the tombs we will drive to Leymebamba. The valley town of Leymebamba is known for its museum which we will visit. The museum houses the cultural remains of the Chachapoya community and exhibitions.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Located 60km Northeast of Chachapoya, the stone-carved tombs can be seen perched on towering limestone cliffs. To delve deeper into the interior of the land, we will also visit the caverns of Quiocta.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Along the way we will pass coffee and sugar cane crops and a suspension bridge that we'll cross to get to a protected area covered by montane mist forest to reach the foot of the high limestone cliff from where the imposing Gocta waterfall precipitates, with an impressive height of 771 metres. After a good portion of hiking we return to the village for lunch.</p><p>Please note:This hike involves going up and downhill.
