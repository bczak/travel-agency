You will be transferred from the airport to your hotel for check in and some time to freshen up and relax.</p><p>This afternoon you will be collected to join a group for your half-day excursion which offers the best combination of the cityâ€™s attractions covering its three historical periods: pre-hispanic, colonial and contemporary. In Lima, there were several different pre-Columbian cultures dating back thousands of years. The area was part of the Inca Empire until the city was founded by the Spanish Francisco Pizarro in 1535 as the capital of the new Spanish empire.</p><p>You will visit Huaca Pucllana, an adobe and clay pyramid built around 500 A.D. before taking in the colonial buildings of the historic centre. It is then on to the metropolitan financial district of San Isidro and the commercial centre built on the cliffs of Miraflores offering panoramic views to the Pacific. The evening is at your leisure</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Upon arrival you will be collected and taken to your hotel by private vehicle. This afternoon you will join a group to explore the churches and cathedral around the charming Plaza de Armas. Your next stop will be the complex of Koricancha which contained the Temple of the Sun, the most sacred site in the Inca religion. It was the centrepiece of a vast astronomical observatory. Little remains of it today except for sections of its stone walls which hint at the sites once massive size. The Christian monastery of Santo Domingo was built on top of the complex, no doubt to signify that one religion had been replaced by another.</p><p>Afterwards, you will drive to the nearby ruins of Sacsayhuaman which reveal the Incas extraordinary architecture. Like all Inca constructions, the stones fit together perfectly without mortar and it would be hard to fit a single sheet of paper even between the biggest. It took almost one hundred years and thousands of men to complete.  Next it is on to a site shrouded in mystery, the large rock and intricate complex of Qenko. The site is named for the zigzag channels carved into the rock which are believed to have been used by Inca priests to pour sacred chicha or llama blood into as part of an annual ritual.</p><p>Tambomachay is thought to be site used to worship water as the source of life. Two aqueducts, artistically carved on the rock, transport and keep a constant flow of clean water.  Your final stop is the red fortress of Puka Pukara which took its name from the colour of the stones (especially at dusk).</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Here the Incas lived, farmed and enjoyed the natural wealth of this verdant region. Visit the colourful and vibrant arts and crafts market in Pisac. The nearby Inca site has a citadel, turrets, military fortresses and astronomical observatories. The largest Inca cemetery in South America is also located here.</p><p>The current town of Ollantaytambo has many houses built on the bases of the old Inca town with local people maintaining their ancestral customs. The complexity of these Inca constructions incorporated into the contemporary town is considered by many to be one of the most important living museums in the world. Above the town, the military fortress that protected this area of the valley prevails strategically between two mountains. On the summit of the archaeological complex stand six enormous monoliths with mysterious engravings of Inca iconography. You will then board the evening train to Aguas Calientes at the base of Machu Picchu. You will be met on arrival by a representative from your hotel who will transfer you there on foot.</p><p>The remainder of the evening is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

You will then have an informative and fun 2 hour guided tour with enough time afterwards to explore the site at your own pace. Please bring your passport with you and you can even get it stamped here if you wish.</p><p>The lost city of Machu Picchu (Old Mountain) was originally completely self-contained, surrounded by agricultural terraces to feed the population and watered by natural springs. While the ruins were only discovered by the outside world in 1911, the site was never really lost and has been continually used for farming by the local people. Located high above the fast flowing Urubamba River, the cloud shrouded ruins have palaces, baths, temples, storage rooms and some 150 houses, all so remarkably preserved that it will take your breath away.</p><p>As you will have return bus tickets, you can make your own way down to Aguas Calientes in time for your train back to Cuzco where you will be collected on arrival and taken back to your hotel by private vehicle. The evening is then at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Whilst this is a full day of driving, there are plenty of stops along the way to stretch your legs and to appreciate some of the history that this route, â€˜The Route of the Sunâ€™, holds.</p><p>Your first stop will take in the Andahuaylillas church, also known as the Sistine Chapel of the Americas thanks to its intricately painted ceilings and other murals. Jump back on the bus and whilst your journey takes you onwards, your next stop takes you further back in time. Built in the fifteenth century, Raqchi is considered by historians to be one of the most audacious Inca constructions. The remarkable Wiracocha temple, 100 metres long and 20 metres wide is made of adobe walls, built on top of volcanic stone foundations.</p><p>You will then stop for lunch in the picturesque Sicuani before driving over La Raya Pass where there is a stunning view across to the snow-capped mountains and over a beautiful old chapel, standing alone in the middle of the Andean plateau. Your final stop is the archaeological site of Pukara which dates back to approximately the first century. The small museum here has items of the lithic Pukara culture.</p><p>You will arrive in Puno in the early evening and you will then be taken to your hotel by private vehicle. Puno is located on the banks of Lake Titicaca, the world's highest navigable lake and stands at an impressive 3,800 metres above sea level. According to legend, it was on this lake that the Sun God commanded his children, Mama Ocllo and Manco CÃ¡pac, to give birth to the Inca civilisation.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

The ancient Uros were originally forced to take up residence on the floating islands when the Incas expanded onto their land and the mobility of the islands was a defence mechanism. Totora reed, which is plentiful along the edges of the lake, is used to make homes, furniture, boats and the islands they stand on. As reeds disintegrate from the bottom of the islands, which are four to eight feet thick, residents must add more to the surface. Each island has a collection of simple reed houses but they are not short of modern conveniences such as solar panels and televisions.</p><p>Later you will travel on to Taquile, an island untouched by the mainland\'s modernity. The local inhabitants, known as TaquileÃ±os, still wear traditional clothing and are known for their high-quality handicrafts. Since 1970, the islands have been governed by the TaquileÃ±os and visitors are greeted by these ancient communities and have the opportunity to share their ways of life. While the women make yarn and weave, knitting is done exclusively by men. Pre-Inca vestiges are found in the highest part of the island. You will return to your hotel in Puno in the afternoon and the evening is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

You will change drivers and vehicle at the border and your driver from Puno will help you cross the border. You will arrive in the late evening and you are then free at your leisure. The city sits within a narrow canyon and it has breath-taking views or it could just be the altitude as you are in the highest capital city in the world. A central cluster of church spires sits dwarfed by the magnificent icebound peak of Mount Illimani and two very distinct societies â€“ the indigenous and the European â€“ coexist with international banks sitting beside street markets selling ritual paraphernalia used in Aymara customs</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Walk the narrow, meandering streets of Rosario, San Jorge and San Miguel, some of La Paz's oldest and liveliest neighbourhoods. Pass through the witches' market, in the middle of the city where Aymara women in traditional Altiplanic petticoats and bowler hats sell medicinal herbs and spices. There are a number of spiritual artefacts as well including, surprisingly, mummified llama foetuses which are supposed to bring good luck in traditional culture.</p><p>As you walk down from the stalls, you will come to the San Francisco cathedral, one of the oldest and largest cathedrals in the city and home to some impressive examples of colonial-era religious art. At the Plaza Murillo, your guide will point out the Presidential Palace and the National Congress, all impressive colonial edifices in the oldest quarter of the city. You can also visit the Costumes Museum and Gold Museum, located on one of the most traditional and oldest street in La Paz.</p><p>Your next stop will be the unique Moon Valley, a fascinating geological anomaly so called because of its bizarre, moon-like landscape. Valle de la Luna has a few kilometres of walking paths that run through the huge stalagmites and trenches of the valley, carved out over centuries of erosion by the wind and rain. In addition to its fascinating geology, there are some impressive views of the Andes Mountains of the Cordillera Real outside the city.</p><p>The afternoon is then free for you to explore as you wish. You will find that the colourful markets on Sagarnaga Street have some of the best shopping in La Paz. The Mercado Lanza, famous for its Api, a hot yellow or purple drink made with cornmeal and traditionally enjoyed with a fresh cheese empanada makes a great refuelling stop.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Upon arrival you will be collected and taken to your hotel by private vehicle. This evening you will head out to watch Argentina's most famous dance, the passionate and dramatic Tango. Folklore has it that it began in the bordellos of long-ago Buenos Aires as men waiting for their 'ladies' passed time by dancing amongst themselves. Today, tango shows are supremely entertaining with their grand feats of athleticism and you will witness these as you enjoy dinner.</p><p>Buenos Aires is an astonishing metropolis that looks a little like Europe, but with a Latin American twist; indeed it is known as the Paris of the Americas. The city's residents, PorteÃ±os ("people from the port"), are passionate and friendly. There are many very different neighbourhoods that make up this cosmopolitan city and each have an identity all their own. The city is easy to negotiate by public transport and it is lovely to cycle around. Check out what the city has to offer on your doorstep or jump on the metro to explore further afield. Buenos Aires is a food loverâ€™s heaven with cuisine from all over the world; Italian food in particular is very good. Of course most people know Argentina for its steaks, and Parrillas (steakhouses) sit on practically every corner.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

You will also get a glimpse of the 10-story high portrait of Evita Peron which has been placed on the Health Ministry building as a tribute. The tour will then take you through the luxurious neighbourhood of Palermo, filled with beautiful buildings, all the way to Recoleta. Here, the incredible cemetrey of the same name is the final resting place of the cityâ€™s most famous residents with countless stunning mausoleums that range from Art Nouveau to neo-Gothic in style.</p><p>Your first stop of the day will be at Plaza de Mayo which is surrounded by historic buildings such as the Casa Rosada, the Cathedral and the City Hall. From here you will continue through the bohemian neighbourhood of San Telmo and on to the famous La Boca Juniors Football Stadium where there will be a stop and you can pay an optional visit inside if you wish.It is then time to make the short transfer to the colourful and iconic barrio of La Boca. This area retains a strong European flavour and you are likely to see Tango performances all around you as you stroll around. Next you will continue along the fashionable Avenida de Mayo and the dynamic Avenida Corrientes to the final stop and end of this trip which is Puerto Madero, a busy gastronomic and entertainment area with many restaurants and bars to choose from.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
