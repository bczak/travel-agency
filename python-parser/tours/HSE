Your adventure starts here in Lima and you are free to arrive today at your leisure.</p><p>Lima was founded by the Spanish Conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 1535 after he eradicated the Incas and made the city his capital. The city has many beautiful colonial buildings and some of the best museums in South America including the Gold Museum, Museum of the Inquisition and the Catacombs below the San Francisco Church.</p><p>Peru's capital has much to offer and many of the sights, including the city's two main squares the Plaza de Armas and Plaza San Martin, boast some fantastic sightseeing opportunities. The Plaza de Armas houses the Cathedral, Municipal Palace and Presidential Palace where the changing of the guard can be seen every day at 12 noon. The city's two main squares - the Plaza de Armas and Plaza San Martin, boasts some fantastic sightseeing opportunities. The former houses the Cathedral, Municipal Palace and the Presidential Palace where the changing of the guard can be seen every day at 12 noon.</p><p>Another highlight of Lima is the Huaca Pucllana, ruins of a pre-Incan pyramid. The clay structure, built in seven staggered levels is one of the few that remain from the historic pre-Colombian period in Peru. It is thought to have been built around 500 AD and would have been used for spiritual ceremonies. Located in the Miraflores district, it's surprisingly very easy to get it!</p><p>Of course you should also spend time sampling some delicious local Peruvian food.

This afternoon we will take a tour of the Sacred Valley of the Incas. You will visit the Pisac ruins, perched on a hilltop with incredible views of the surrounding mountains. You will also visit the temple/fortress of Ollantaytambo with its enormous Inca terracing constructed on the side of a steep mountain. Tonight you will stay in Ollantaytambo in preparation for your journey to Machu Picchu tomorrow.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Tika Wasi or similar .

As a result, if you are scheduled to take the train to Machu Picchu, your guided tour will take place in the afternoon shift.</p><p>Alternate options for getting to Machu Picchu:</p><p>Taking the train: Waking early in Ollantaytambo you will take the train to Aguas Calientes, arriving at 10am. You will have time to get some food before entering Machu Picchu at approximately midday. Enjoy a guided tour around the site before getting the train back to Ollantaytambo and arriving back in Cusco at approximately 10pm.</p><p>One day hike:Waking early in Ollantaytambo you will take the train to to Km104 (2100m) where you will start the trek heading towards the ruins of Chachabamba. From here you will follow the Inca Trail to the foot of the Wiñay-Wayna ruins (2700m), hiking until you reach Sun Gate and Machu Picchu in the late afternoon.  Enjoy a guided tour around the site before getting the train back to Ollantaytambo and arriving back in Cusco at approximately 10pm.</p><p>The lost city of Machu Picchu (Old Mountain) was originally completely self -contained, surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to feed the population, and watered by natural springs. Located high above the fast flowing Urubamba River, the cloud shrouded ruins have palaces, baths, temples, storage rooms and some 150 houses, all in a remarkable state of preservation that will simply take your breath away. The ruins were only discovered by the outside world in 1911, when American explorer Hiram Bingham found them while looking for another “lost city” called Vilcabamba. Due to their isolation many of the buildings are still quite intact and you can't help but admire Huayna Picchu (Young Mountain), which towers above the ruins.</p><p>Please note:  The one day hike generally can be booked more closer to departure unlike the Inca Trail however as it is still permit-regulated this is no guarantee. Please enquire with your Adventure Specialist for availability. It is a long day and can be quite challenging.

Not only is it the largest lake in South America, it sits at 3,800 meters above sea level making it the highest navigable body of water on earth. Crystal blue waters compliment the bright yellow grass reeds used to construct the homes and boats floating upon it, while the traditional clothing simply adds to the beauty and colour of the place. While the lake tends to be overshadowed by its biodiverse and world famous neighbour the Amazon jungle, there exists over 500 aquatic species here and many various birds.</p><p>First we visit the floating reed islands in the Bay of Puno to see the Uros islanders way of life and we will have the option to ride in a traditional reed boat.</p><p>Next stop is Taquile Island, an island on Lake Titicaca still holding up many of the traditions values and customs it was built on. Learn about the way of life, from the reasons for why they do their hair the way they do and how they dress. Famous for their textiles and clothing, you will be able to pick up a homemade gift or two from the main square.</p><p>We will return to Puno for the evening.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Munay Tambo or similar .

Just about every building in La Paz is built on some sort of hill, so sightseeing will literally take your breath away! You will have time to explore La Paz and it's bustling atmosphere. Our hotel is very centrally located and is just around the corner from the city's colourful indigenous street markets including the fascinating and suitably named ?Witches Market'? where local women in traditional 'Cholita' dress sell such items as dead cats and llamas foetuses said to ward off evil spirits. The main square, Plaza Murillo, is also within walking distance. The square still retains its colonial buildings including the Presidential Palace.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Sagarnaga or similar .

First on the agenda is a visit to the Train Cemetery, where you can see the remains of 19th and early 20th century steam locomotives - a good place for artistic photographs. We will then come to Colchani, the main plant for the iodisation of salt and the best place to observe the methods of salt extraction from the salar. Here ovens are used to dry the salt, which is then formed into cakes. From here we drive onto the Salt Flats themselves. Claimed to be the largest salt flat in the world, the brilliant white vast Salar de Uyuní, which covers some 10,500 square kilometres and is estimated to contain 10 billion tons of salt, looks like something from a surrealist painting and its seemingly infinite horizons will amaze you. You will then visit either Fish Island or Incahuasi Island (seasonal dependent). Located in the centre of the Salar, 100 kilometres from Uyuní, this hilly outpost is covered in giant cacti amid a flat, white sea of hexagonal salt tiles.The otherworldly views from the islands will take your breath away, with the brilliant blue sky (weather permitting of course) contrasting with the pure white of the salt flats.</p><p>Please Note: Occasionally in the rainy season the salt flats become overly flooded and we may have to alter the itinerary if the salt flats are not safe to traverse. Your tour leader will advise as early as possible if this is likely to happen on your tour.</p><p>Please Note:The accommodation here is basic with limited facilities. Please see your tour notes for further details.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hostels (basic multi-share hostel) or similar .

You will see a variety of dramatic landscapes including smoking volcanoes, barren deserts and gravity-defying rock formations carved by the wind. In this incredibly empty landscape you'll most likely feel the furthest from civilisation you've ever been. You will visit  a number of lagoons including Cañapa, Chairkota and Laguna Honda. You will also get to see the Laguna Colorada, which offers some truly breathtaking scenery, with several varieties of flamingos gathering in the shallow waters of the beautiful crimson lagoon. Before arriving at Laguna Colorada you will pass Arbol de Piedra, the famous Stone Tree.</p><p>Please Note:The temperatures can get very cold and often drop below zero when crossing the Bolivian Altiplano, especially the winter months from May to September. You may wish to bring a sleeping bag if traveling in the winter months. A sleeping bag can also be rented from your Tour Leader for 70 Bolivian Bolivianos. Also note that on occasion in winter snow can cause the itinerary to be altered at short notice.</p><p>Please Note:The accommodation here is basic with limited facilities.

We make our way to San Pedro de Atacama, making a few stops on the way. We visit the volcanic zone ‘Sol de Mañana' (Morning Sun) at 4,850 metres above sea level. Here you'll discover a geyser basin with bubbling mud pots, hellish fumaroles and a thick aroma of sulphur fumes. Inside a small crater we will observe mud bubbling away and we will also stop at hot springs where you can bathe. We will pass the Desert of Salvador Dali before crossing a 5,000 metre pass. We then come to the beautiful Laguna Verde, which is shadowed by the cone of the Licancabur Volcano. Next to Laguna Verde is Laguna Blanca, known as the White Lake. Continuing on we will cross into Chile. On the way we get the chance to see both the Bolivian and Chilean sides of the 5960m Licancabur Volcano.</p><p>We then come to San Pedro de Atacama in the world's driest desert. The area is famous for the salt-covered lunar landscapes, geysers, salt flats and hot springs of the Valley of the Moon, which we will explore by van tomorrow.</p><p> Please Note: Upon exiting Bolivia you will be required to pay a small fee of 20 Bolivianos.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Don Raul or similar .

Due to its remote location and dry climate, the Atacama desert offers some of the clearest skies in the world and as such is used by international space agencies to monitor the skies. If you are lucky enough to have clear nights during your stay in San Pedro de Atacama, the starscape will most likely be the best you'll ever see.</p><p>Today we enjoy an excursion to the Valley of the Moon. The various stone formations have been formed by the wind and rain over time, resulting in unique and interesting shapes, similar to the surface of the moon. In fact, it is said a prototype of the Mars rover was tested in the area!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Don Raul or similar .

Nestled in central Chile, the city is framed by the tall and snow capped Andes mountains which on a clear day give the city the most stunning backdrop.</p><p>Santiago is a very clean, modern city with many fountains and parks, but also has its own turbulent history. It is well-known for its fresh markets such as the famous La Vega Central Market, and the Mercado Central, one of the best seafood markets in the world. You can see the changing of the guard most days outside the impressive Palacio de La Moneda, the seat of the President of Chile. In the 1970s, the palace was bombarded during the military coup d'état, ushering in a dark period in Chile’s national history.</p><p>For the best views of the city, take a funicular railway or hike to the top of San Cristobal, where the Statue of the Virgin overlooks the capital and the distant Andes. Here you can taste some of Chile's best wines and find some beautifully situated swimming pools.</p><p> Please Note: We will depart early to maximise our time in Santiago, therefore breakfast is not included on this day.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Libertador or similar .

Under the shadow of the Andes, this picturesque place is most known for it’s incredible wine valleys.</p><p>Mendoza is where General José de San Martín organised the army with which he liberated Chile and Peru from Spanish rule in 1818. Unfortunately, few historic buildings remain after an earthquake devastated the city in 1861. However, the city was rebuilt on a grid system, resulting in the broad tree-lined streets and beautiful green plazas for which the city is famous. There are great views from the top of “Cerro de la Gloria” at Parque San Martíno.</p><p> Please Note: For the departure that arrives in Rio in time for Rio Carnival 2020, your itinerary will operate slightly differently spending an extra night in Mendoza. Please speak to an Adventure Specialist for more details.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Urbana Suites or similar .

Since the wine boom in the early 20th century, Mendoza has held its title of the largest wine growing area in Latin America, and one of the best in the world. Sitting at the foot of the Andes, the vineyards are planted at some of the highest altitudes and since the region doesn’t experience extreme temperatures, a variety of grapes are able to flourish here.</p><p>Today your group will enjoy an excursion to a local vineyard as well as a charming olive farm. Sample some of the finest wine in the region (including the world renowned Malbec!) while learning more about the history and production of wine.

To make sure you see as many of the city's historic sites as possible in the time available, we suggest taking a sight-seeing bus, which you can hop on and off as you wish. You'll see Avenida 9 de Julio (the widest avenue in the world), the impressive Teatro Colón, one of the world's best opera houses, and the famous Casa Rosada, Argentina’s presidential palace, from where Juan and Eva Perón famously addressed the crowds gathered on Plaza de Mayo in 1945.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel TWO or similar .

Wander around the variety of craft markets, where you may come across live bands, barbecues, make-shift bars and practising tango dancers for a truly atmospheric Latin-American experience. San Telmo is the best market for antiques, while the market at Recoleta has great hand-made crafts. No visit to Buenos Aires would be complete without a stroll around the upmarket boutiques and cafés of the Palermo district, and the contrasting bohemian barrio of La Boca, where inhabitants of the area used left-over paint from the nearby shipyards to paint their humble houses made of scrap metal in bright, block colours.</p><p>The city is also world-renowned for its incredible nightlife, with many nightclubs, bars, restaurants and cinemas open all night. For a great evening, you could see an authentic tango show in the city where the dance originated, and you can’t leave Buenos Aires without trying some of the best steaks in the world!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel TWO or similar .

Unlike most other waterfalls that have just one or two cataracts, at Iguazú Falls there are 275 cataracts in a magnificent 3 kilometre long U shape that we will visit from both sides. Visiting the Argentine side of the falls you can board a speed boat which will take you under the falls soaking you from head to toe, an optional adventure you'll never forget! On the Argentine side you'll also find the famous "Devil's Throat" where fourteen falls drop with such force that there is always a massive cloud of spray overhead. Following this we transfer to Brazil by land.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Taroba Express or similar .

You can walk from the top of the staircase up to the quiet hill-top neighbourhood of Santa Teresa, with many quaint cafés and shops lining the cobblestone streets. In the city centre, you can stroll around Rio's old colonial buildings and wander around the skyscrapers of the financial district.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Regina or similar .

your tour in Lima</name><description><p>Please always check your tour voucher before you travel.</p>
<p>Arawi Miraflores Express Hotel<br /> Calle Bol&amp;iacute;var 464<br /> Miraflores<br /> Lima<br />Peru</p>
<p>Tel: (+51) 1 7434660</p>
<p>Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques in the hotel when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you. Be careful of pickpockets everywhere, but especially on the pedestrian street Jiron de la Union. It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major South American cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Lima</h5>
<p>On arrival in Lima, we recommend you change enough money into the local currency (the Peruvian nuevo sol) for the first four or five days of your trip. This is especially important if you are arriving on a Saturday night. The bank is located on the far right as you enter the baggage claim area after passing through passport control. There is an ATM in the airport arrivals area which will give you Peruvian soles or US dollars, so make sure you pay attention when it asks you which currency you want.</p>
<p>ATMs in Peru do not always automatically release your credit or debit card at the time when you receive your money. Please be aware that you sometimes have to push a button to request your card to be returned. Many ATMs in main towns have instructions in English.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you decide not to pre-book an arrival transfer, you can either take a taxi from one of hundreds of touts outside or arrange a taxi at one of the pre-pay taxi desks just after customs. Recommended companies include Taxi CMV and Taxi Mitsui Remise. For safety and convenience, we recommend you use the taxi desks as haggling with touts and taxi drivers can be very difficult, particularly if you do not speak Spanish. The cost of a taxi from the airport to our hotel in downtown Lima should be approximately US$15 to $25. The airport is approximately 30 to 45 minutes from the city centre (depending on the traffic).</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Don't take unmarked taxis in Lima, and preferably don't travel alone by taxi, particularly late at night.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a great variety of accommodation, providing you with unique experiences to last a lifetime! You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<p><strong>Uyuni Salt Flats</strong> - You will spend one night in a traditional local hostel made from salt blocks. The rooms are multi-share with up to 4 people per room with communal bathrooms and showers. There is limited hot water and towels are not normally provided so you should ensure you bring your own. We highly recommend taking a sleeping bag as it can get incredibly cold at high altitude at night. Unless you have rented one for the Inca Trail, you will already have one for this. It is essential to have warm clothes. The lighting and power are on for limited hours and there are communal charging stations available. Accommodation in the salt flats in sparse and the area is very under-developed, meaning there is no light pollution. While the facilities here are basic, standing under the clear night sky is a wonderful experience!</p>
<p><strong>Laguna Colorada National Park</strong> - In Laguna Colorada National Park you will stay in a local hostel with multi-share rooms with up to 7 people per room. There are communal bathrooms however there is no hot water and no showers. There is also no heating and so it can be very cold in winter and again warm clothes are essential. There are no power outlets or charging stations so ensure all your electronics are fully charged and it&amp;rsquo;s also recommended to take a portable charger with you.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. The only locations where you will be in multi-share dorms are Uyuni Salt Flats and Laguna Colorada National Park.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans.

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses four different currencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peruvian Sol</li>
<li>Bolivian Boliviano</li>
<li>Chilean Peso</li>
<li>Brazilian Real</li>
</ul>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is part of life in South America. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Free Walking Tours</h5>
<p>Free walking tours are found in many of the large cities. These are marketed as free walking tours and are designed to provide travellers with local, in depth knowledge of the city. However all free walking tours are tip based (they have to make money somehow, after all!) and so if you wish to join a free walking tour you need to budget in a tip at the end. Leaving a free walking tour that was considered a good tour without tipping is very disrespectful and will only give travellers a bad reputation.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of Asian cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p>
<p>Overall the food scene in South America is incredible and you will get to experience everything from local lunches in rural areas to high end restaurants in the bigger cities. The markets in Cusco and the Central Market in Santiago are especially good to pick up some local treats. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>South America has some amazing markets selling delicious food. Eating at local markets is a great way to experience authentic food and at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in South America</h5>
<p>South America is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Altitude Sickness</h5>
<p>All clients warrant and accept that there is a chance they may get some form of altitude sickness on itineraries that generally travel to altitudes over 2,400 metres though Tucan Travel will not expose clients to any undue risk of altitude sickness. Tucan Travel tour leaders, staff and local suppliers working at higher altitudes will have some level of knowledge and / or training on how to help and advise you. Please read the information contained <a href="high-altitude-sickness">here</a> to ensure you understand the risks and what to do in this event.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip.
