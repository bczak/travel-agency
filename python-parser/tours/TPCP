The city's residents, Portenos ("people from the port"), are passionate and friendly.</p><p>There are many very different neighbourhoods that make up this cosmopolitan city and each have an identity all their own. The city is easy to negotiate by public transport and it is lovely to cycle around. Check out what the city has to offer on your doorstep or jump on the metro to explore further afield. Buenos Aires is a food lover?s heaven with cuisine from all over the world; Italian food in particular is very good. Of course most people know Argentina for its steaks, and Parrillas (steakhouses) sit on practically every corner.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Once everyone has been collected, you will begin with a drive along 9 de Julio Avenue where you will find the renowned Colón Theatre, as well as the Obelisk which you will see rising high above the porteños below. You will also get a glimpse of the 10-story high portrait of Evita Peron which has been placed on the Health Ministry building as a tribute. The tour will then take you through the luxurious neighbourhood of Palermo, filled with beautiful buildings, all the way to Recoleta. Here, the incredible cemetrey of the same name is the final resting place of the city’s most famous residents with countless stunning mausoleums that range from Art Nouveau to neo-Gothic in style.</p><p>Your first stop of the day will be at Plaza de Mayo which is surrounded by historic buildings such as the Casa Rosada, the Cathedral and the City Hall. From here you will continue through the bohemian neighbourhood of San Telmo and on to the famous La Boca Juniors Football Stadium where there will be a stop and you can pay an optional visit inside if you wish.It is then time to make the short transfer to the colourful and iconic barrio of La Boca. This area retains a strong European flavour and you are likely to see Tango performances all around you as you stroll around. Next you will continue along the fashionable Avenida de Mayo and the dynamic Avenida Corrientes to the final stop and end of this trip which is Puerto Madero, a busy gastronomic and entertainment area with many restaurants and bars to choose from.</p><p>This evening you will head out to watch Argentina's most famous dance, the passionate and dramatic Tango. Folklore has it that it began in the bordellos of long-ago Buenos Aires as men waiting for their 'ladies' passed time by dancing amongst themselves. Today, tango shows are supremely entertaining with their grand feats of athleticism and you will witness these as you enjoy dinner.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

If you would like a little time to relax there are many green spaces such as Costanera Sur Ecological Reserve, an 865-acre swath of marshland along the Rio de la Plata. Follow the path from the park's southern entrance and you will soon be surrounded by reeds poking out from ponds which are home to egrets and swans with green parrots squawking overhead.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Laguna Torre is a gentle day hike that leads to a lake at the base of the dramatic 3128 metre rock spire of Cerro Torre.</p><p>A more challenging day hike takes you up to the Laguna de los Tres, approximately four hours one way, with great views of Fitz Roy en-route and a great place for a lunch stop by Laguna Capri. It is only safe to ascend the steep final 1.5 kilometres if it is not windy but if it is not possible to make this final hike, the cobalt-blue lagoon and cliff viewpoint overlooking Laguna Sucia makes a great compromise.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

With a height of approximately 60 metres and a front of five kilometres (three miles), covering some 250 square kilometres, the glacier is an incredible sight and is one of the few glaciers in the world to be growing slightly, not decreasing in size as most glaciers do. Named after Argentine explorer Francisco  Moreno, the glacier is coloured in a variety of hues from blue to grey to white and continually creaks and cracks. Advancing at a speed of around two metres per day, it can put on a spectacular show when giant chunks of ice at the outermost edges crack under tremendous pressure, rupture and crash into the water- a process known as calving. You will have the chance to walk around the paths and terraces where you will get some great views of the glacier and you will also take a boat ride around the glacier to get even closer.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Torres del Paine is named after three massive granite towers that rise out of the earth and offer an unforgettable backdrop to an already-striking region. Covering more than 180,000 hectares, the park boasts stunning scenery with snow covered mountain peaks, glaciers, beautiful lakes and valleys with a diverse variety of unusual flora and fauna. Some of the varied and amazing creatures you might spot include skunks, Andean condors, black-chested buzzard eagles, chilla foxes, culpeo foxes, guanacos (a relative of the llama), Chilean flamingos and rhea. Vividly-coloured flowers, various evergreen plants and orchids may also be seen. The best way to discover the national park is on foot and trekking here will take your breath away.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Perhaps take a glacier boat tour across Lago Pehoe where weather permitting you can see into the French Valley, Paine Grande and Los Cuernos. There are many guided walks on offer which showcase the best of the national park and where you can witness some amazing glacial views.</p><p>Some of the walks are quite demanding, and at a high altitude, but there are a good range of options for all grades of walkers. One such trek offers incredible views of the famous ?towers?, the three distinctive granite peaks of the Paine mountain range. It?s quite challenging, with the whole route being 19km, however it is well worth it. For the longer treks such as the ?towers? walk, a reasonable level of fitness is required and passengers must be prepared for all weather conditions. We recommend packing trekking boots, waterproof trousers and a positive outlook to all weather!</p><p>If you feel you need to give your legs a rest, go horse riding through the valleys for some of the most picturesque views from horseback.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Take in the breath-taking natural wonders, Patagonian lakes and charming scenery in the world's southernmost National Park. As you enter the park, you will be surrounded by native Lenga beech and Ñire forests, sour-cherry trees, rivers, lakes and peat bogs; components that make the landscape indescribably beautiful and typically Patagonian. Visit Ensenada Bay and you will be left speechless by the incredible outlook from the shore which reveals spectacular views of the Beagle Channel, Lapataia Bay and Redonda Island. You will continue on your journey to Lake Roca. Take a further stroll along the shore of the lake to try to see one of the inhabitants of the park - the beavers, an introduced species that have wreaked havoc on some of the areas within the park.</p><p>This afternoon you will then journey in Charles Darwin’s footsteps and set out from the dock to sail along Ushuaia bay and the Beagle channel from where you will enjoy beautiful views of the city, its main buildings and Olivia and Cinco Hermanos hills. Sail on towards Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse where you will see a cormorant rookery. On your way back, you will get closer to Sea Lion Island to see these animals in their natural habitat, as well as seabirds such as the imperial cormorants, albatross and skuas among others. The evening is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
