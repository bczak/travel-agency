Your adventure starts in Cusco, a city of beautiful Spanish colonial architecture and the once capital of the Inca Empire. While the city is usually seen as the gateway to the iconic Machu Picchu, Cusco is well worth exploring in itself.</p><p>Discover the Plaza de Armas, the cultural centre of the city and where you can find many bars, restaurants and local coffee shops. Visit the Cathedral, which was built with blocks from the nearby Inca site of Sacsayhuaman and took almost a century to complete.</p><p>We highly recommend arriving to Cusco a few days prior to the start of your tour to help with acclimatisation. If you would like to book pre-tour accommodation please contact your Adventure Specialist.</p><p>Tonight you will have a briefing on what to expect over the next few days and your journey to Machu Picchu.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anden Inca or similar .

Firstly we visit the Pisac ruins, perched on a hilltop with incredible views of the surrounding mountains. We then go down to the famous traditional market of the same name, which is full of colour and atmosphere. A great place for souvenirs! After lunch, we continue along the valley to the temple/fortress of Ollantaytambo with its enormous Inca terracing constructed on the side of a steep mountain.</p><p>Tonight you will stay in the town of Ollantaytambo in preparation for an early departure to Machu Picchu tomorrow.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Tika Wasi or similar .

One of the most beautifully preserved Inca citadels in the world, the mystical views have to be seen to be believed.</p><p>Today is that day, and you will enjoy an included train ride to the beautiful ruins followed by a guided tour of the site. Waking early in Ollantaytambo, your group will take a local train to Aguas Calientes where you have time to get some food. Enjoy some stunning views as you journey through the lush Peruvian countryside witnessing mountain vistas, small communities as well as other smaller Inca sites.</p><p>From Aguas Calientes, you will hop on a tourist bus for the final short (around 20 minutes) journey to the site.</p><p>The lost city of Machu Picchu was originally completely self -contained, surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to feed the population, and watered by natural springs. Located high above the fast flowing Urubamba River, the cloud shrouded ruins have palaces, baths, temples, storage rooms and some 150 houses, all in a remarkable state of preservation that will simply take your breath away. The ruins were only discovered by the outside world in 1911, when American explorer Hiram Bingham found them while looking for another “lost city” called Vilcabamba. Due to their isolation many of the buildings are still quite intact and you can't help but admire Huayna Picchu (Young Mountain), which towers above the ruins.</p><p>After your guided tour and some free time to explore the ruins, you will get the train back to Ollantaytambo, arriving back in Cusco at approximately 10pm.</p><p>Options for getting to Machu Picchu:</p><p>Taking the train: Waking early in Ollantaytambo you will take the train to Aguas Calientes, arriving at 10am. You will have time to get some food before entering Machu Picchu at approximately midday. Enjoy a guided tour around the site before getting the train back to Ollantaytambo and arriving back in Cusco at approximately 10pm.</p><p>One day hike: Waking early in Ollantaytambo you will take the train to to Km104 (2100m) where you will start the trek heading towards the ruins of Chachabamba. From here you will follow the Inca Trail to the foot of the Wiñay-Wayna ruins (2700m), hiking until you reach Sun Gate and Machu Picchu in the late afternoon. Enjoy a guided tour around the site before getting the train back to Ollantaytambo and arriving back in Cusco at approximately 10pm.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anden Inca or similar .

Take a walking tour and admire the colonial buildings or wander the colourful San Pedro Market, where you can find fruits and vegetables in abundance as well as other local delicacies.</p><p>A 45 minute walk from the centre lies Sacsayhuaman, another ancient Inca site that is well worth the journey for both the incredible views of Cusco and the interesting stonework. You can also catch a glimpse of Cristo Blanco, the large statue of Christ that towers above the city.</p><p>Spend the evening back at Plaza de Armas and experience Cusco after dark. With plenty quaint restaurants and vibrant bars around, the plaza is as lively as during the day.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anden Inca or similar .

Covering nearly two thirds of the country, the area is home to around 600 species of birds, 1200 types of butterflies and 300 reptiles, to name a few. As eco-tourism continues to grow, there are a number of eco lodges allowing you to experience the rainforest in the most responsible and authentic way possible.</p><p>Our local representative will transfer you to the airport for your flight to the jungle community of Puerto Maldonado, the starting point for our visit to the Amazon rainforest. Here you can pick up last minute drinks and snacks before the group continue with a short bus ride followed by riverboat journey to reach the accommodation for the night. Sailing along the river, the trip takes around 2 hours and is an excellent chance to relax and start to take in the magic of the rainforest.</p><p>Arriving at your riverside lodge, check in and have some time to relax before an afternoon of exploring. After lunch we will set off on a trek through the rainforest along wooden walkways. On the way our guide will stop to show you various species of bird and explain the medicinal plants and delicate ecological systems of the Amazon Jungle. The scenery is extremely varied incorporating dense jungle as well as marsh areas. You will see incredibly big trees, several metres in diameter and around 450 years old. We walk to Cochita Caiman (Caiman Pond) where we see wildlife along the way. We then return to the lodge for dinner.</p><p>Please note: The eco-lodges in the Amazon jungle are designed to give travellers the most authentic jungle experience while limiting disruption to the animals and plantlife. The bungalows are built from local indigenous materials with the rooms sealed by mesh netting to keep mosquitoes out. All rooms have private bathroom facilities however these are basic and hot water can be limited. There is portable water available at the lodge therefore we recommend taking a reusable water bottle with you. Electricity is limited and it is advisable to bring portable chargers for your electronics and ensure they are fully charged. After dark, the walkways are lit by oil lamps. The lodges include a welcome area, dining room and bar, meaning there are plenty areas for your group to relax and socialise. Single supplements are not available in the bungalows. If you have further questions on what to expect, your tour leader will be happy to assist. All excursions in the jungle are led by an English speaking guide.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a jungle lodge at Eco Amazonia Lodge or similar .

We will return to the lodge for a well deserved lunch.</p><p>After a break and some yummy food, we take a short boat trip across the Madre de Dios River to Monkey Island. On the way over you may spot caiman from the boat. Once on the island it is possible to see a great variety of monkeys such as the ‘maquisapa’, black and white ‘Martins’, ‘Leoncito de la Selva’ (Little Lions), ‘Frailes’ (Friars), ‘Achuñis’, ‘Ronsocos’ as well as an array of birdlife. In the evenings it is often possible to enjoy the wonderful sunset, one of the most impressive sights of the forest (weather permitting).</p><p>Enjoy your final night in the heart of the jungle soaking up this magical and peaceful atmosphere.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a jungle lodge at Eco Amazonia Lodge or similar .

After a boat back to Puerto Maldonado, followed by a two hour flight you are met by our local representative and transferred to your hotel for the evening.</p><p>Lima was founded by the Spanish Conquistador Francisco Pizarro in 1535 after he eradicated the Incas and made the city his capital. Lima has many fine colonial buildings and some of the best museums in South America including the Gold Museum, Museum of the Inquisition and the Catacombs below the San Francisco Church. Peru's capital has much to offer and many of the sights, including the city's two main squares the Plaza de Armas and Plaza San Martin, boast some fantastic sightseeing opportunities. The Plaza de Armas houses the Cathedral, Municipal Palace and Presidential Palace where the changing of the guard can be seen every day at 12 noon. There are also many markets in Lima, possibly the best being in the central district.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Arawi Miraflores Express Hotel or similar .

The white-sand beaches offer great open walking with brilliant migratory bird watching opportunities; look out for black-necked stilts, ruddy turnstones, whimbrels and white-cheeked pintails.

Here you will learn more about the lava terrain and hike cross the inactive lava fields. Besides the sea lion colonies, this is one of the most important sites for bird watching. Many species, like the hooded mockingbird and red-billed tropic can be spotted and observed closely. Past the nesting grounds you&amp;#39;ll reach the world&amp;#39;s largest colony of waved albatross. From May to December their mating rituals are a highlight of the visit. Later you will visit the famous blowhole where water shoots about 23m (75ft) high.</p><p>Difficulty Level: Difficult</p><p>Type of Terrain: Rocky</p><p>In the afternoon we continue on to Gardner Bay for a wet landing on a white coral beach amidst a large colony of sea lions. This site has no trails, so hiking is not possible. It?s an open area where you can spot Galapagos hawks, American oyster catchers, Galapagos doves, and hood mockingbirds, three species of Darwin finches, yellow warblers, lava lizards and marine iguanas.</p><p>This is also a great area for swimming and snorkelling and you can see many Galapagos marine species like king angelfish, Creole fish, damsel fish, parrot fish, manta rays and white tipped reef sharks.</p><p>Difficulty Level: Easy</p><p>Type of Terrain: Sandy</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on boat  at Coral Expedition Cruise or similar .

We hike through black mangrove beds, view plants endemic to the island and enjoy the nesting sites of the Green Pacific Sea Turtles. You will not be able to walk in the water in case of sting rayes in the sand but you can see sea turtles and blue footed boobies feeding.</p><p>Floreana has had a colourful history: Pirates, whalers, convicts, and a small band of somewhat peculiar colonists - a Baroness among them - who chose a Robinson Crusoe existence that ended in mystery and death. Today roughly fifty Ecuadorians inhabit the island. Punta Cormorant offers two highly contrasting beaches; the strand where the yacht anchors is composed of volcanic olivine crystals, giving it a greenish tint that glitters in the sun. From here a trail crosses the neck of the isthmus - which rises to form a cinder cone - to a beach of very fine white sand, formed by the erosion of coral skeletons. Between the two beaches is a salt lagoon frequented by flamingos, pintails, stilts and other wading birds.</p><p>In 1793 British whalers set up a barrel as the island&amp;#39;s Post Office to send letters home on passing ships. The tradition continues to this day, simply by dropping a post card into the barrel without a stamp. The catch is you must take a post card from the barrel and see that it gets to the right place. That is how the system began and continues to this day. Some claim it works better than the post office. Seen 250m north from Punta Cormorant is an old submerged volcanic cone that has been worn down by waves. Devil's Crown is home to a myriad of marine species including a variety of corals, pencil sea urchin, wrasses, angelfish, amberjacks and many other creatures, making for some of the best snorkelling in the Galapagos. The eroded crater walls form a popular roosting site for seabirds including boobies and pelicans.</p><p>Difficulty Level: Easy</p><p>Type of Terrain: Sandy</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on boat  at Coral Expedition Cruise or similar .

your tour in Cusco</name><description><p>We use a variety of centrally located hotels in Cusco, so please double check your voucher provided for all the necessary details of your accommodation.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Cusco</h5>
<p>Cusco is located at 3,330 metres above sea level, making it an exceptionally high city. You may feel the effects of altitude, which&amp;nbsp;affects all people differently.&amp;nbsp;If you have just arrived&amp;nbsp;it is&amp;nbsp;suggested you take it&amp;nbsp;very easy for the first day and follow the below recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drink plenty of water, around two to two-and-a-half litres per day. Bottled water is available everywhere.</li>
<li>The affects of alcohol and cigarettes are made considerably worse by the thin air. Try to avoid these in excess for the first few days.</li>
<li>Take it easy. Walk slowly and avoid sudden movements.</li>
</ul>
<p>On arrival in Cusco, we recommend you change enough money into the local currency (the Peruvian nuevo sol) for the first four or five days of your trip. This is especially important if you are arriving on a Saturday night. The exchange rate at the airport is not quite as good as in the city centre, but if you arrive with nothing you will need to change a little. The exchange counter as well as ATMs are located in the departures area of the airport. The ATMs in the airport will give you Peruvian soles or US dollars, so make sure you pay attention when it asks you which currency you want.</p>
<p>ATMs in Peru do not always automatically release your credit or debit card at the time when you receive your money. Please be aware that you sometimes have to push a button to request your card to be returned. Many ATMs in main towns have instructions in English.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p><strong>Arriving by air</strong><br /> If you decide not to book an arrival transfer, you can take a taxi immediately outside the arrivals area of the airport. The black taxis parked here are all registered and safe. The cost of a taxi from the airport to our hotel in Cusco should be approximately US$4 to $6. The airport is approximately 10 to 15 minutes from the city centre (depending on the traffic).</p>
<p><strong>Arriving by bus</strong><br /> If you arrive by bus into Cusco, you should take a taxi immediately outside bus terminal as continuing your journey using local transport to the hotel with luggage can be very difficult. Pick one of the newer and labelled taxis. The cost from the terminal to our hotel in Cuzco should be approximately US$1 to $2. The bus station is approximately 5 to 10 minutes from the city centre (depending on the traffic).</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Don't take unmarked taxis in Cusco, and preferably don't travel alone by taxi, particularly late at night.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and a cruise for the Galapagos Islands.

</ul></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the Peruvian sol.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of South American culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold in some locations, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<h5>Flights</h5>
<p>If your tour includes internal flights please be aware there is often a restriction of 15kg for checked baggage. If your luggage exceeds this weight you will need to pay any fees incurred.</p>
<p>In general, South America is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis.</p>
<h5>What essential items should I bring to South America?</h5>

<li>A small daypack - This should have enough room to carry food and snacks for long hikes or day trips.</li>

<li>Insect Repellent (DEET 35% min) and bite cream.</li>
<li>Layers - We recommend packing lightweight and durable clothes. Nights can be cold at higher altitude so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</li>
<li>Portable Electronics Charger - There will be limited to no charging facilities on the Inca Trail, Amazon Jungle, Uyuni Salt Flats and Laguna Colorada. If you wish to keep your phone and camera charged you will want to ensure you bring a portable charger that holds a few charges.</li>

Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in South America</h5>
<p>South America is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Altitude Sickness</h5>
<p>All clients warrant and accept that there is a chance they may get some form of altitude sickness on itineraries that generally travel to altitudes over 2,400 metres though Tucan Travel will not expose clients to any undue risk of altitude sickness. Tucan Travel tour leaders, staff and local suppliers working at higher altitudes will have some level of knowledge and / or training on how to help and advise you. Please read the information contained <a href="high-altitude-sickness">here</a> to ensure you understand the risks and what to do in this event.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
