The three great pyramids that are part of The Giza plateau date back from a period of construction between 3,800 and 2,800 BC and are located on the West bank of the River Nile because of the symbolism associating with the realm of the dead when the sun sets there in the evenings.</p><p>After an exciting day of exploring these great ancient monuments you will head to the train station to board your overnight sleeper train to Aswan.

A site not to be missed!</p><p>Alternatively you can spend the morning relaxing before boarding your traditional felucca boat to embark on an unforgettable sailing adventure down the River Nile.

There is an international ATM inside the airport, as well as money exchange offices offering a good rate. The rate will always vary slightly depending on where you go.

<h5>Ramadan</h5>
<p>In 2020, Ramadan will fall between the 23rd April and 23rd May. Ramadan is a month long period of fasting observed by Muslims where they should not eat or drink between sunrise and sunset. Generally, our tours will operate as normal during this period although there may be some limitations to services in certain areas. Food is still available to non-Muslims however you should display a higher level of cultural sensitivity and try to refrain from eating, drinking or smoking in public during this time out of respect for those who cannot. In addition to this you should also ensure that your clothing covers knees and shoulders. If you have further questions about what to expect please contact an Adventure Specialist.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour includes a variety of accommodation that is chosen based on comfort, cleanliness and location.

<p>This tour uses the Israeli New Shekel, Egyptian Pound and Jordanian Dinar.</p>
<h5>Tipping Kitty</h5>
<p>Tipping is part of the culture in the Middle East, so we have included the cost of most of the tipping on this tour. This will include the tip for any included meals, excursions, transport and accommodation staff. Please note that should you take part in optional excursions that are separate from the tour, the tip will not be included. The tipping kitty also does not include a tip for your tour leader at the end of the tour. If you feel that your tour leader has provided excellent service, a discretionary tip is always appreciated.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in the Middle East will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost unless stated as included in the literary. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the Middle East, there is a huge choice of incredible food.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><p>The Middle East is generally safe, even more so in a group tour. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
