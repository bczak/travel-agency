Your tour will begin with an arrival transfer from the airport to your accommodation in Havana. You are free to arrive at your leisure and you will meet your tour guide and fellow travellers tonight.</p><p>Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean and it sure does pack a punch &amp;#45; drawing eager travellers excited to see what the fuss is all about. Essentially cut off from the rest of the world until the embargo was lifted in 2015, Cuba is now a thriving destination with an electric culture. Your days in Cuba will consist of sunshine, music, history, beaches and an overall contagious atmosphere! From the colourful colonial buildings to the picture perfect 1940s cars, Cuba is taken straight from a postcard.</p><p>Havana is considered the beating heart of Cuba. The UNESCO Old Town is a wonderful place to stroll around, taking in the architecture and colours that surround you. Wander Centro Habana, the most colourful district in Havana and check out Havana Viego, where the majority of UNESCO sites are situated. Learn from the Revolution Museum or explore the National Museum of Fine Arts.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in casas particulares .

There is a museum where you will further learn about the history, and you will then have some time to swim or snorkel in what can only be described as one of Cuba&amp;#39;s best reefs!</p><p>We then continue onto Cienfuegos, also known as the Paris of the Caribbean due to its wide boulevards and expansive parks. In 1819 the city was settled by French migrants who made it their home. French influence can be widely seen throughout the city and many of the streets reflect the French language in their name: Bouyon and D&amp;#39;Clouet for example.</p><p>Upon arrival we will enjoy an orientation walk of the city. Get your camera ready for the charm and history that will be found throughout! We will visit the Castillo de Jagua, the ancient fort that once protected Cuba from pirate attacks. We will stroll through the picturesque Parque Jos&amp;#233; Mart&amp;#237; before relaxing by the oceanfront walkways of Malecon. Finally, we will make a stop at the gorgeous Palacio de Valle, a historic villa designed by an Italian architect, where we will enjoy an included drink.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in casas particulares .

Santa Clara holds a special place in the revolutionary history of Cuba and today oozes a youthful culture and lively nightlife due to having one of Cuba&amp;#39;s largest universities.</p><p>Santa Clara is infamous for being one of the final and bloodiest battles in the revolution, and is the final resting place of Che Guevara &amp;#45; a hero of the Cuban Revolution. Guevara arrived on New Years Eve in 1958, fighting against the regime of General Batista. A mere 12 hours into the battle, Batista fled Cuba and the revolutionaries claimed victory. Guevera quickly became a key figure in the Cuban Revolution and later attempted to incite the same in Bolivia - ultimately leading to his execution. His body was returned to Santa Clara and laid to rest in what is now known as the Che Guevara Mausoleum.</p><p>We then continue to Trinidad, one of Cuba&amp;#39;s most alluring destinations. The town was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988 and we guarantee you will find beauty around every corner, from the cobbled streets to the smiling residents. You will enjoy a guided Trinidad Township walk, learning about the history and culture of this fascinating town.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in casas particulares .

Arriving late afternoon you can enjoy getting acquainted with the village and all it has to offer.</p><p>Located in Western Cuba, Vi&amp;#241;ales was established in 1878 and consists of wooden houses and picturesque valleys as far as the eye can see.

As you wander the site, you will see several tall mounds which have not yet been excavated, and you will have the opportunity to climb some of the tallest Mayan temples.</p><p>The emphasis was on height when creating these imposing structures because the Maya believed the higher the building, the closer they were to the gods.

your tour in Havana</name><description><h3>Joining your tour</h3>
<p>Your joining information will be provided around one month before departure. The documents will include further information on joining and details on your local guide plus phone numbers.</p>
<p>Airport transfers are included in the tour price. You must advise Tucan Travel of your flight details and arrival time so that this can be arranged. If your flight or travel plans change before joining your tour please ensure you contact our office to update us. If your plans change on the day, please contact the emergency number below.</p>
<p>Your airport transfer will be waiting just to the side of the Infotour bureau in the arrivals lounge with a sign with your name on it. Please note that we are not affiliated with Infotur, this is just an easy landmark to identify in the arrivals lounge.</p>
<h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If your flight is delayed or travel plans altered please try and contact us as soon as possible on +5353070220 or +53 53967021.</p>
<h5>Taxis</h5>
<p>Can't locate your driver? If for whatever reason you can't find your transfer driver at the airport, please check both outside and inside the terminal. You should then try and contact us through the numbers provided above. If you do not have a mobile phone, please visit the airport information desk and ask them to call for you. On the very rare occasion that you cannot locate your driver or contact us, it is very easy to get a taxi at Havana airport. Taxis are always available from the taxi ranks in front of all the terminal buildings. A taxi ride from the airport to downtown Havana takes approximately 20-30 minutes and costs 20-25 CUC one-way. Always agree the fare first as some taxis have meters but they are rarely switched on. You can provide the taxi driver with the your joining accommodation address below.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a great variety of accommodation, providing you with unique experiences to last a lifetime! You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<p>Our Cuba tours stay in "casas particulares" which are local Cuban homestays. This is the best way to ensure the money is going back to the local communities and also provides travellers with a wonderfully authentic experience. Each casa will be different but you will always enjoy a private room for you and your partner/friend/roommate. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. If you are travelling as a couple and wish to book a double bed, please advise your Adventure Specialist at time of booking.</p>
<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on all occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning.

<p>You will be carrying your own luggage on tour. Please limit this to one piece per person plus one day bag.</p>
<h5>Flights</h5>
<p>If your tour includes internal flights please be aware there is often a restriction of 15kg for checked baggage. If your luggage exceeds this weight you will need to pay any fees incurred.</p>
<p>It is important to bring luggage you can carry and lift comfortably, potentially up several flights of stairs in hotels where elevators are not available and between bus/train stations and hotels.</p>
<h5>Packing List</h5>
<p>Please consider which season you are travelling in and pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, Central America is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong to cover up for this.</p>
<p>What essential items should I bring to Central America and Cuba?</p>
<ul>
<li>A small daypack - This should have enough room to carry food and snacks for long hikes or day trips.</li>
<li>Good, comfortable walking shoes or trainer AND flip flops. You will need comfortable trainers for any day hikes you wish to enjoy on this trip and flip flops or other sandals are essential for the beach.</li>
<li>Insect Repellent (DEET 35% min) and bite cream.</li>
<li>Sunscreen - This should be a large bottle and enough to cover you for Cuba. Buying sunscreen in Cuba is expensive - around 25 dollars to it&amp;rsquo;s best to take some from home!</li>
<li>Portable battery charger - this can come in handy if you are unlucky enough to experience power shortages in Cuba and need to charge your camera or phone.</li>
<li>Swimwear &amp;amp; towel - While the casas in Cuba do provide towels you might want one for when you are at the beach or stopping over at areas like the Bay of Pigs!</li>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the below currencies:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Mexican Peso</li>
<li>Belize Dollar</li>
<li>Guatemalan Quetzal</li>
<li>Cuban Peso</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Central America will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<p>Some shops and restaurants in Cuba accept card but it is not common and we suggest not to rely on this. Please ensure you have access to cash for the duration of your stay.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Spending Money in Cuba</h5>
<p>It is best to bring CAD$, Euro or Sterling to Exchange for CUC's in Cuba. Please note that the Cuban government surcharges an extra 10% to exchange USD$ in Cuba. With regards to the use of Credit or Debit cards in Cuba the following applies. No card issued by a bank that has any connection with the United States will be accepted in Cuba. Debit/ Credit cards with the VISA logo can be used in ATM's or to draw money from a Cadeca or Bank. MASTERCARDS will not be accepted in ATM's but, as with VISA cards, so long as they are issued by a non US based bank, can be used to draw cash at the counter of a Cadeca or Bank.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to the rules above, so please check with your bank/ payments provider before travelling to Cuba.</p>
<p>Please review this Trip Advisor <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Travel-g147270-c69372/Cuba:Caribbean:Currency.And.Credit.Cards.html">link</a> for further details</p>
<p>For US travellers - check out this recent <a href="http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-tr-spot-20150621-story.html">article</a> for an analysis of whether to convert your U.S. cash to another currency.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of Central American culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Departing Cuba</h5>
<p>The Cuban government does not allow for CUC currency to leave the country, therefore you should aim to spend it all before leaving for the airport. If you have currency on you, authorities have the right to confiscate this at the airport AFTER check-in. There are a few shops in terminal 3 (before check in) where you may spend CUC on souvenirs if you have some left. There is also a money exchange booth in terminal 3 where you can change remaining CUC into USD, CAD, GBP or EUR, however there is never a guarantee the booth will have enough money so we recommend not to rely on this for changing large amounts. In terminal 3, AFTER check-in, there is no where that will accept CUC and you must pay in either USD, CAD or EUR. These rules also apply to terminal 2.</p>
<h5>Free Walking Tours</h5>
<p>Free walking tours are found in many of the large cities, especially in the larger cities where you will find a few companies offering the same tour. These are marketed as free walking tours and are designed to provide travellers with local, in depth knowledge of the city. However all free walking tours are tip based (they have to make money somehow, after all!) and so if you wish to join a free walking tour you need to budget in a tip at the end. Leaving a free walking tour that was considered a good tour without tipping is very disrespectful and will only give travellers a bad reputation.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of Asian cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p>
<p>Food in Central America varies between each country. Mexico is known for having some of the best food on the continent while Costa Rica is known for its fresh and tropical fruit. Vegetarians will have no problem finding delicious meals, as many of the dishes are rich in rice, beans, vegetables and eggs.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>Central America is known for having some of the best street food in the world. Eating at local markets is a great way to experience authentic food and at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in Central America</h5>
<p>Central America is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<p>Travel Insurance</p>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<p>Pack a Medical Kit</p>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<p>Vaccinations</p>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. There are no official required vaccinations for Central America however if you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<p>Horse Riding</p>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible. Please read our comprehensive guide <a href="about-us/responsible-travel/">here</a> before you travel.</p></description></item></tripNotes><whatYouShouldExpect><p>This tour is made up of two separate tour segments. You will have one tour leader in Cuba, and another tour leader from Playa del Carmen to Antigua. Your group will fly from Havana to Cancun with no tour leader, however be assured you will be dropped off and met by local representatives.</p>
<p>The group size in Cuba will be a maximum of 15 people. Once you reach mainland Central America the group size will be a maximum of 19 people.</p>
<p>You will be staying in Casas Particulares. These are local Cuban Bed &amp;amp; Breakfasts and the most authentic way to stay in Cuba. While they are comfortable and nicer than a lot of Cuban accommodations - they may be more basic that you are used to back home.</p>
<p>Cuba is still developing - power cuts and breaks in hotel water can happen from time to time. Internet access in Cuba is not like other places. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect chance to disconnect from online and truly immerse yourself in the country!</p>
<p>Life in Cuba is relaxed and slow - it&amp;rsquo;s the Caribbean way after all. Patience and a good sense of humour will go a long way and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect everything to run like it does back home.</p>
<p>This tour visits places that require a decent level of walking, such as ancient Maya sites. You will need a decent level of fitness to fully enjoy this tour.</p>
<p>This tour has a few long travel days. These are unavoidable when covering such large distances however a good book and your new friends will make the time pass quicker.</p>
<p>This tour uses a mixture of transport - two flights, busses, private vehicles and ferries. It is essential that you can carry your own luggage.</p>
