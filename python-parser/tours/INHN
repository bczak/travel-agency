The backstreets around Durbar Square and Palace are bustling with life with throngs of people going about their lives and selling on the road. Random cows wander the streets, taxis hoot and narrow alleyways overflow with spices, vegetables and handicraft shops with intriguing and unpleasant smells, incessant noise and pollution – triggering a sensory overload. You could also venture to ominously named freak street or Jochne named by the hippies during the 1970s.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Kathmandu Prince or similar .

Lumbini is said to be the place where Gautama Buddha 'the apostle of peace and the light of Asia' was born in 623 B.C. The most important temple at Lumbini is the Maya Devi Temple, marking the traditional site of the Buddha's birth. The temple stands on the site of earlier temples and has been a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of years. The area around Lumbini is entirely Hindu, but many Buddhist temples and shrines from various nations are scattered around the holy site itself.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Lumbini Guesthouse or similar .

The park is situated in south central Nepal, covering 932 square kilometres in the subtropical lowlands of the inner Terai. The area comprises the Tikauli forest - from Rapti river to the foothills of the Mahabharat - extending over an area of 175 square kilometres. The area became the country's first National Park in 1973.</p><p>We stay near the entrance of Chitwan National Park and you will have a choice of optional excursions to enjoy from canoeing and jungle walks to jeep safaris as you keep an eye out for the elusive tiger. In the evening, after a delicious dal baat dinner we watch a Tharu Cultural Dance Show, understanding the different interpretations of the Tharu dances.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Chitwan Park Village or similar .

The deep valleys and high mountains surrounding the Annapurna Himal include varied terrain, from subtropical jungle to a high, dry landscape.</p><p>We spend two days hiking through the Annapurna foothills. The views are breathtaking and the trails are scenic. A guide explains the flora and fauna that we pass and we are assisted by porters who carry your toiletries and a change of clothes. We sleep in rustic lodges along the way and pick up litter along the route. It is a magical two days where you get the opportunity to walk through small villages.</p><p>Please Note: The first day of trekking covers roughly 11 km with mostly uphill terrain.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in lodges at Australian Camp Guesthouse or View Top Lodge or similar .

your tour in Kathmandu</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Kathmandu Prince Hotel<br />Chhetrapati<br />Thamel<br />Kathmandu<br />Nepal</p>
<p>Tel: 4255961, 4255282<br /> www.kathmanduprincehotel.com</p>
<p>There are safe deposit boxes for your use (you will get an itemised receipt). Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you. It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Kathmandu</h5>
<p>On arriving at Kathmandu International Airport you will find money changers at the airport; they charge a service fee and offer a worse rate than is offered in Thamel where our joining hotel is located, so it is recommended to extract a small amount of cash when you first arrive. The local currency is the Nepalese rupee.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<p>Contact your arrival transfer:<br /> Contact: Nepal Operations Team<br /> Phone: +91 (0) 9999780391</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel, a taxi ride to Thamel should not exceed 300 rupees. You can order a taxi at the pre-paid booth inside the airport, which costs 450 rupees. This is more than the meter rate, but saves the hassle of long negotiations.</p>
<p>You will need to pay for your taxi in Nepalese rupees, you may have to bite the bullet on a low exchange rate at the airport and change a small amount for a taxi to the hotel.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a variety of hotels. You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. If you wish to book a double bed, please advice your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>
<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on most occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans. The mode of transport is chosen based on schedule and timings, comfort, group size, location and reliability. Transport in India and Nepal is generally comfortable and all part of the adventure.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport.</p></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><h5>Luggage</h5>
<p>You will be carrying your own luggage on tour. Please limit this to one piece per person plus one day bag.</p>
<p>It is important to bring luggage you can carry and lift comfortably, potentially up several flights of stairs in hotels where elevators are not available and between bus/train stations and hotels.</p>
<h5>Packing List</h5>
<p>All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cooler depending on the season you are travelling, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus a thinner sweater which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, Nepal is a conservative country and you should keep your legs and shoulders covered when out in public and especially when entering places of worship.</p>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the Nepalese rupee.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Kathmandu will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of Nepalese culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost unless stated as included in the itinerary. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In India and Nepal, there is a huge choice of incredible food.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance before meeting your tour please call (+66) 633 21 0066.</p>
<h5>Safety in India and Nepal</h5>
<p>India and Nepal generally safe, even more so in a group tour. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<p>Travel Insurance</p>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<p>Pack a Medical Kit</p>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<p>Vaccinations</p>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera, Diphtheria and influenza.</p>
<p>Horse Riding</p>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
