Many villagers live a traditional life as little changed since pre-Columbian times and they still wear richly-woven costumes, the colours and designs varying from place to place. The scenery is breath-taking - volcanic landscapes, beautiful lakes surrounded by forest-cloaked volcanoes and tropical rainforest, much of which hides vast complexes from ancient civilisations. The Spanish also left their mark, most notably in Antigua with its shady plazas and colonial houses and courtyards.</p><p>On arrival at Guatemala City Airport you will be transferred to Antigua</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

You will visit the Arco de San Catalina which was built to keep nuns from sight when their convent expanded to the building across the street. You will see the San Francisco Church, built in 1542. It is the oldest functioning church in the city. On a sunny day, the vibrant yellow paint and intricate white carvings of La Merced Church are stunning. The attached monastery houses a huge fountain in the shape of a water lily, a symbol from the Maya indicating that the ancient religions were incorporated into Catholicism.</p><p>When you have had your fill of history, you will head out to the local market on the fringes of the old town. You can find almost anything you may need here and a few things you may never have thought of as well. You will also visit the Chocolate Museum where you will be able to see the process of taking the cacao bean to the chocolate bar. Finally, you will travel to the La Azote Coffee Farm and the Mayan Musical instruments Museum. The evening is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

After exploring Livingston, return to Rio Dulce village where you take a bus to Tikal.</p><p>The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Tikal covers more than 200 square miles and was the most important city in the Mayan world. The city flourished between about 200 and 900 AD and has became overgrown by the encroaching rainforest and was lost to the world. In the seventeenth century its existence began to draw global attention and from 1956, the site has begun to be excavated and archaeologists continue to uncover more of the site, increasing the understanding of the history of the civilisations that made Tikal their home. You will have a guided tour of the site with lunch included.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
