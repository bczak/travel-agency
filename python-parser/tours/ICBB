This loud, vibrant and tantalizing city is the centre of economics in Thailand and is seen as the gateway to South East Asia for most travellers.</p><p>Today you are free to arrive at your leisure and enjoy the various activities in the city. We highly recommend booking pre tour accommodation to maximise your time here.</p><p>One of the biggest highlights of the city and a must see is the opulent Grand Palace, which was built in 1782 and was home of the Thai King for over 150 years. The palace complex has several impressive buildings such as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Just walking around this vast area will give you an idea of the spectacular Thai architecture and vibrant colours. Another must see is the temple of Wat Pho, which houses the impressive reclining Buddha. The position of the Buddha represents entry into Nirvana and the end of reincarnations and is an important symbol for Thai people.</p><p>Today you can also visit the famous Chatuchak Weekend Market, Bangkok's largest market which is also said to be the largest in the world. There are over 15,000 stalls offering anything and everything that you could dream of. Mingle with the locals and immerse yourself in the bustle of vendors and shoppers going about their daily lives.</p><p>Tonight you will have a pre departure meeting to meet your tour leader and group. Please check reception for details and timings.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at New Siam II or similar .

We disembark at Wat Pho and visit the famous reclining Buddha.</p><p>This afternoon perhaps spend time soaking up the culture and art scene in one of the many museums dotted around the city. For history buffs, you could easily spend hours soaking up the information in the National Museum, which was Thailand's only museum until the mid 1970?s and has a large and very impressive collection. The Bangkok Art and Culture Centre is a work of art in itself, and you can explore the exhibits which range from photographs to paintings. The Tonson Gallery is excellent for those interested in contemporary art, while the Baan Kamthieng House Museum is perfect for learning more about rural life in Thailand.</p><p>In the early evening we will meet our group and tour leader back at the hotel and head to the train station for the overnight train to southern Thailand!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on overnight sleeper trains .

Staying nearby you have the chance to visit the national park and tropical rainforest, which is older than the Amazon Jungle. The area of Khao Sok National Park is an incredible 739 square kilometres, including the 165 square kilometre Cheow Lan Lake. The park is the most biodiverse jungle in Thailand and as well as holding many wild animals has an amazing array of flora and fauna, as well as various bird species. Mammals found in the rainforest include the tapir, Asian elephant, sambar deer, wild boar, white handed gibbons and bears.</p><p>The landscapes are beautiful, with lush jungle complimented with breath-taking limestone cliffs and hidden waterfalls. It is also home to the rare Rafflesia Kerrii, the world's largest flower. Khao Sok is the only place in Thailand to find it.</p><p>After an orientation of the surrounding area you are free to explore the park or simply wander around the breathtaking area. While the area is rural and tranquil, there are various restaurants and hotels in the area serving fresh and good quality local food.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Nature Place or similar .

The lake is a popular base for many activities including kayaking, canoeing and bamboo rafting. The views from the water are stunning as you pass limestone cliffs and see various fish swimming below.</p><p>For those who enjoy hiking there are various paths around the park to follow, many of which lead to beautiful waterfalls. A great way to experience this is to hire a local guide who can talk you through the animals that live in the area and show you the best places to see in the rainforest.</p><p>Caves in the area, such as Diamond Cave, Khang Cow Cave and Nam Talu Cave, all connect to the lake and can be explored on a boat trip.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Nature Place or similar .

Thailand's largest island, Phuket offers some of the country's most popular beaches and is located close to popular islands including James Bond Island (Khao Phing Kan) or Racha Island (Ko Racha Yai) famed for its diving and snorkelling.</p><p>We hop on a private minibus and travel for around three hours to reach our hotel in Phuket. The rest of the afternoon is free to start enjoying the sunshine filled beaches and glistening waters. The hardest decision of today will be whether you snorkel or paddle board first!</p><p>Phuket comes alive at night with various restaurants, bars and live music venues. From all night laser nightclubs to laid back beach bars, there is something for every taste and every budget on the island. The food choices are endless, you could enjoy the fresh seafood on offer or the various small eateries serving up typical Thai dishes. Your tour leader will be able to recommend the best ones.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at 99 Residence Patong or similar .

Thailand's famed islands have been the set for many films over the years and hold a certain mystique. Take a boat trip and explore as many as your heart desires or snorkel around the bays amongst stunning exotic fish and other marine animals.</p><p>Of course beaches and islands are not to everyone's taste, so why not visit the historical Old Phuket Town, small enough to stroll around but with an abundance of differing cultural histories. See the Big Buddha, a white, 45 metre tall effigy of Buddha with 360 degree views of the island. Wat Chalong is one of the most significant temples on the island and is beautifully decorated with many shimmering pieces on the pagodas.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at 99 Residence Patong or similar .

your tour in Bangkok</name><description><p>Your joining hotel is:</p>
<p>New Siam 2 Hotel<br />50 Trok Rong Mai<br /> Phra-A-Thit Road<br />Phranakorn<br />Bangkok 10200<br /> Thailand</p>
<p>Tel: (+66) 02 280 1465</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Sometime joining hotels are subject to change. Please double check your Tour Voucher before you travel.</p>
<p>There are safe deposit boxes for your use (you will get an itemised receipt). Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you.</p>
<p>It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Bangkok</h5>
<p>When arriving at Bangkok International Airport we recommend that you obtain some Thai baht as soon as you arrive. There is an international ATM inside the airport, as well as money exchange offices offering a good rate. The rate will always vary slightly depending on where you go, it may be worth changing a small amount of money at the airport for your transport, and then finding a bank or money exchange within the town centre. There are many ATM&amp;rsquo;s and money exchanges close by to the hotel should you want to change them after checking into the hotel.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you arriving in to Suvarnabhumi International Airport (BKK) and have an arrival transfer booked, after exiting customs, please turn right, continue down the walkway past the counters, where your driver will be waiting by door 3 or 4 holding a TucanTravel sign with the main passenger's name on it, Please do not exit the building. Please note that Bangkok BKK airport is very congested and if you do not see your driver immediately please take the time to look around and if necessary contact the local Tucan Travel representative on the contact number shown on your voucher.</p>
<p>If you are arriving in to Don Mueang Airport (DMK) from outside Thailand (International) and have an arrival transfer booked, please turn right after exiting customs and walk approximately 20-30 metres to Door&amp;nbsp; No. 3 where your driver will be holding a Tucan Travel sign with the main passenger's name on it.</p>
<p>If you are arriving in to Don Mueang Airport (DMK) from within Thailand (National) and have an arrival transfer booked, your driver will be waiting behind the barrier immediately in front of you after exiting customs, holding a Tucan Travel sign with the lead passenger's name on it.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel, a public taxi is the easiest. At the airport, exit the customs area and turn right. Ignore all touts in the airport terminal offering taxi services and proceed down to Level 1, following the blue signs for &amp;ldquo;Public Taxis&amp;rdquo;. Outside the arrival building on the first floor (one floor down from arrivals) you will see the &amp;ldquo;Public Taxi&amp;rdquo; desks.</p>
<p>Give the dispatcher the name of your joining hotel. He or she will give you a slip of white paper. Hold onto it, do not give it to the driver, because it has instructions on what to do in the unlikely event of any problem. The dispatcher will give another part of the form to the driver.</p>
<p>When you get into the taxi, make sure the meter is on and showing 35 baht and ignore any 'helpful' advice from the driver to strike a cash deal off the metre. On arrival at the hotel, you will pay the fare on the meter, plus an airport surcharge of 50 baht that is not shown on the meter. In addition there may be optional expressway tolls of 75 baht which you should pay directly to the driver at the two toll stations. Typical costs would normally be around 400-500 baht in total (including metered fare, surcharge and tolls).</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a variety of hotels and guesthouses. You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. If you wish to book a double bed, please advice your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>
<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on most occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p> 
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans. The mode of transport is chosen based on schedule and timings, comfort, group size, location and reliability.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport.</p>
<h5>Approximate travel times on this trip</h5>
<p>The below information provides approximate travel times and modes of transport for your tour. Please note that modes of transport may be subject to change depending on the group size and timings may vary depending on the season and border crossings on the day.</p>

</ul></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cooler depending on the season you are travelling, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus a thinner sweater which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, Southeast Asia is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong for this. When packing, please consider that any included flights on your tour have a luggage weight restriction of 20kg.</p>

<h5>Laundry</h5>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p>
<h5>E-Cigarettes</h5>
<p>Please be aware that many countries in Southeast Asia have banned the use of e-cigarettes and it is not possible to bring them into the country with you. Please check regulations before you depart.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the That baht.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Southeast Asia will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. In general, Southeast Asia is a cheap destination.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of Southeast Asian culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of Asian cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<h5>Breakfast on tour</h5>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box with a few simple pieces to keep you going. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local noodles or congee.</p>
<h5>Vegetarian Food</h5>
<p>Finding vegetarian or vegan food in Southeast Asia is surprisingly easy, especially in the bigger towns and cities. As long as you do some research it is easy to find vegan restaurants in larger cities. Southeast Asian cuisine uses an abundance of noodles, rice and fresh vegetables, so you won&amp;rsquo;t be stuck for something to eat.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>Southeast Asia is known for possibly having the best street food scene in the world. From delicious Thai noodles to the more acquired taste of fried spiders in Cambodia, there is a lot to get your teeth around. Eating at local markets is a great way to experience authentic food and at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p>
<p>Overall Southeast Asia has a fantastic food scene and it should not be missed!</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>

<h5>Safety in Southeast Asia</h5>
<p>Southeast Asia is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<p>Travel Insurance</p>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<p>Pack a Medical Kit</p>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<p>Vaccinations</p>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera, Diphtheria and influenza. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling. It is also a good idea to be vaccinated against rabies if you will be coming into contact with animals.</p>
<p>Horse Riding</p>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip.
