You are free to arrive today at your leisure and start enjoying all that Moscow has to offer.</p><p>Golden onion domes and towering skyscrapers, cosy cafes and hushed churches, Russia's capital city is beautiful, atmospheric and overflowing with history. There is plenty to see and do here, including numerous cathedrals, museums, art galleries, palaces, the State History Museum and the iconic St Basil's Cathedral, towers and monuments. We highly recommend arriving in Moscow a day or so earlier to make the most of this fascinating city.</p><p>Moscow's Red Square (Krasnaya Ploshad) is the main centre of the city and was a market place during the fifteenth century. The red part of its name does not refer to Communism or to the colour of the stone (which is actually grey) but derives from the old Russian word krasniy meaning beautiful. During the Soviet regime the square was known for its May Day parades and is the site of Lenin's Mausoleum.</p><p>It is said that soon after January 21, 1924, the day that Vladimir Lenin died, the Soviet government received more than 10,000 telegrams from all over Russia, which asked the government to preserve his body somehow for future generations. Lenin's tomb, and final resting place, was then promptly set about being designed and a wooden tomb was constructed within 6 days of his death. A larger mausoleum was constructed later that year and stands today in the centre of the city in the prominent Red Square.</p><p>There will be a pre departure meeting held in your hotel at 6pm tonight. Please check reception for details.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Izmailovo Gamma or similar .

It has been ruled by Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles and Russians, with the more distinctive Estonian identity coming to light in the late 19th century. During World War II, Estonia was ultimately incorporated into the Soviet Union after years of contest, which lead to years of communist rule. On August 20th, 1991, Estonia gained its independence.</p><p>Modern day Estonia is progressive and traditional all in one. In 2005, they became the first country to hold elections over the internet, and in 2014 the first country to make e-residency possible. The city of Tallinn has been listed as one of the most digitally advanced in the world, with the likes of Skype emerging from the small city.

The tile marks the southern end of the 2 million person, 650 kilometre long human chain between Tallinn and Vilnius, which was formed in protest against Soviet occupation in 1989. Local legend has it that if you find the pretty mosaic-covered tile you should stand on it and turn around three times clockwise while making a wish, which shall then be granted.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Panorama or similar .

Known as the 'Jerusalem of Europe', the city was once famous for its religious diversity, with people of Islamic, Orthodox Christian, Catholic and Jewish faiths coexisting relatively peacefully for centuries. The atmosphere of calm and tolerance changed dramatically when violence erupted in the mid-1990s and the city underwent the longest siege in modern military history during the Yugoslav War.</p><p>Today the city is largely recovered and is packed with fascinating museums, bazaars, markets and bridges.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Hecco or similar .

Built in 1556 by the Ottoman ruler Suleiman the Great, Stari Most had been a globally recognised landmark and a national symbol for Bosnia-Herzegovina. It had survived centuries of conflict including both world wars and proved that, whatever happened, the mainly Christian west bank and mainly Muslim east remained united. The destruction of the bridge was a devastating event to the local people, but in 2004 the bridge was rebuilt as a replica of the original using pieces of masonry salvaged from the riverbed. Its reopening represented the hope that Muslims, Croats and Serbs could once again live side by side and that Mostar would be healed after a decade of ethnic division.</p><p>Wonder the bazaar, stroll along the river and admire the quintessential Ottoman architecture, or take a short taxi drive to the beautiful Blagaj Tekke Monastery. End your evening in a quaint local restaurant overlooking the river. With influence from the Ottomans and Mediterranean, Bosnian cuisine is said to be some of the best in Eastern Europe.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Motel Kriva Cuprija I or similar .

A popular spot for nature lovers, swimmers and photography buffs alike, you will have time to enjoy the area before heading to Hvar Island. Boasting more sunshine hours than any of the other sun-soaked Dalmatian islands, Hvar Island offers fairytale Venetian architecture, a waterfront promenade fringed by palm trees and centuries old walls. Arriving late afternoon, you will have the full day tomorrow to enjoy the various optional excursions available.</p><p>Built by the Venetian Doges in the 13th century, Hvar Town is a maze of cobblestone streets and sunny squares bordered by al fresco cafes and restaurants. The most important sights such as St Stephen's Cathedral, Clock Tower and the Arsenal flank the main square, while a picturesque expanse of terracotta-roofed houses and tiny streets cover the hill behind.</p><p>With all of this and an historic fortress overlooking it all, it's no wonder picturesque Hvar Town is considered a chic destination for the rich and famous, and you may be lucky enough to see one or two familiar faces here.</p><p>Please note: Breakfast is not included in Hvar since we will be using local apartments and homestays.

Istanbul is an enchanting fusion of East and West. Narrow alleys are flanked by wooden Ottoman houses while a nearby funky restaurant and bar strip in the down-town area pumps out Turkish pop. There are many great places to explore including, but not limited to, the Blue Mosque, St Sophia and the Grand Bazaar. The Blue Mosque, also known as the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet, is nearly 400 years old and still an active mosque that non-Muslims can visit for free outside of the five daily prayers. St Sophia (Hagia Sophia) was built 1,500 years ago and was the largest enclosed space in the world. The Grand Bazaar (Kapali Carsi) is the oldest and largest closed bazaar in the world, housing around 3000 shops within 61 alleyways. It used to be the city's main trading centre of ceramics, jewellery and leather goods.</p><p>We will arrive in the evening to sample some of Turkey's most delicious cuisine. As we arrive late we recommend you book additional nights accommodation in order to fully explore the city and any of the optional excursions listed below.</p><p>Please note: For those who do not wish to travel into Turkey, there is the option to end in Sofia, Bulgaria instead. From Plovdiv you will return to Sofia by bus where there will be one night's accommodation instead. This option must be pre-booked with your Adventure Specialist in advance. This makes no difference to the cost of your tour.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Centrum or similar .

your tour in Moscow</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Hotel Gamma Delta @ Izmailovo Hotel Complex<br />Building Gamma<br />71, 4 G-D, Izmailovskoe shosse, <br />Moscow, <br />105613,</p>
<p>Phone: +7 495 737-7000</p>
<p>Below is the address of Hotel Gamma Delta Izmailovo in Cyrillic, helpful for taxi drivers.</p>
<p>Измайлово отель Гамма-Дельта<br />Корпус Гамма, Измайловское шоссе 71 4 Г-Д , Москва</p>
<p><br />The hotels have safe deposit boxes for your use. Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you.</p>
<p>It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Moscow</h5>
<p>When arriving at Domodedovo International Airport (34 kilometres south of Moscow) or Sheremetyevo International Airport (29 kilometres northwest of Moscow), we recommend that you obtain some Russian rubles as soon as you arrive. There are numerous international ATMs inside the airports. The rate will always differ slightly depending on where you go. The airport does offer a decent rate and it may otherwise be inconvenient to find an exchange office open in the city, depending on what time you arrive</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact address below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>

<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel, taxis are available&amp;nbsp;from the airports but you may have problems finding drivers who speak English. The journey&amp;nbsp;should cost approximately 1,500 rubles from airports. The taxi&amp;nbsp;should be on a meter (make sure they start it when you begin your journey) and you pay the driver when you arrive at the hotel. <br /> <br /> Moscow is equidistant from all the airports and the the journeys take approximately an hour depending on Moscow traffic which can be notoriously bad.</p>
<p>As taxis are expensive you may prefer to&amp;nbsp;use public transport where possible:</p>
<p style="clear: left;">To connect to the Metro network from Domodedovo Airport you can take a shuttle bus to Domodedovskaya Metro station. Travel time to Partizanskaya is about two hours.</p>
<p>From Sheremetyevo Airport the No. 851 bus goes to Rechnoy Vokzal Metro station. Travel time to Partizanskaya is about one hour and 20 minutes.</p>
<p>From Vnukovo International Airport, take the Bhykobo Commuter Train in the city and then transfer to the Metro. Travel time is approximately 1 and a half hours.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You must validate your Russia visa within 72 hours of your arrival in each Russian city. This can be done when you check in at your hotel.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a variety of hotels, guesthouses and apartments. You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites.</p>
<p><strong>Hvar Island</strong></p>
<p>On Hvar Island, we stay in locally owned apartments, guesthouses and homestays. We choose this because we want to ensure that our money is going back to the local community and they can benefit off tourism.

Breakfast is not included in Hvar and your tour leader will advise where is best to have breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p>Accommodation on this trip is on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. If you wish to book a double bed, please advise your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>

<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on most occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p> 
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning.

<p>You will be carrying your own luggage on tour. Please limit this to one piece per person plus one day bag.</p>
<p>It is important to bring luggage you can carry and lift comfortably, potentially up several flights of stairs in hotels where elevators are not available and between bus/train stations and hotels.</p>
<h5>Packing List</h5>
<p>Please consider which season you are travelling in and pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<p>Good, comfortable walking shoes are essential. There can either be comfortable trainers or walking shoes. You will find you walk a lot in Europe, sometimes on uneven and cobbled streets.</p>
<p>In general, Europe is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong to cover up for this.</p>

If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of European cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Food in Europe differs between countries. In Eastern and Central Europe, the standard diet is mostly meat based. Vegetarians will have options but may find themselves more limited than back home. Vegans and those on a gluten free diet will find it more challenging and you might need to pick up your own supplies at a supermarket.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to meeting your tour please call (+44) 788 7498 617.</p>
<h5>Safety in Europe</h5>
<p>Europe is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h5>Scams in Europe</h5>
<p>Unfortunately there are many common scams occurring regularly across Europe. While these are normally harmless to your personal safety, they can leave you losing money. The most common are people approaching you seemingly offering a gift, to then turn around and ask for money, children distracting you while someone goes through your bag, people pretending to be stranded/lost/mugged and asking you for money or people asking you to sign a fake charity petition, while someone else dips into your pocket. Pickpocket gangs often work in teams, so while one bumps into you and fumbles around apologising, another might be searching for a wallet. These scams are easily avoided by keeping your bag zipped at all times and on your front in crowds, and using your common sense when someone approaches you.</p>
<h5>Traffic and crossing the road</h5>
<p>Traffic is Europe can be hectic. You should always look both ways before crossing the road, depending on the country they might drive on the other side of the road. Rules on jaywalking can vary between countries, so we suggest always using pedestrian and zebra crossings.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible. Please read our comprehensive guide <a href="about-us/responsible-travel/">here</a> before you travel.</p></description></item></tripNotes><whatYouShouldExpect><p>This group tour ranges in size from 4 to 17 people, with an overall average of 10 people.</p>
<p>This tour is modular and made up of multiple smaller sections. This means there will be people leaving and joining at various points. This also means you will have different tour leaders throughout the tour. One tour leader will lead you from Moscow to Riga, one from Riga to Budapest, one from Budapest to Budapest (the Balkans loop) and another from Budapest to Istanbul.</p>
<p>This tour includes one overnight train. Pillows and sleeping sheets are provided but you may want to bring ear plugs and a sleep mask.</p>
<p>This trip is 66 days long, spending an average of two nights in each location. While you will see a huge amount, it is fast paced and you should consider your fitness levels before booking.</p>
<p>Europe is cobbled streets, winding staircases and lots of walking. You will need a decent fitness level to fully enjoy this trip.</p>
<p>This trip uses a range of public buses, trains and private vehicles. You will be responsible for carrying your luggage at all times, on and off transport and sometimes up stairs, or along cobbled streets. You MUST ensure you can comfortably carry it, and keep to one piece of luggage and one small bag.</p>
<p>Hotel rooms in Europe tend to be much smaller than in America, Canada or Australia. Double beds are sometimes two single beds pushed together.</p>
<p>This trip requires you to have a Russian visa. While we can assist you with the necessary visa support documents to help with your visa application, it is your responsibility to arrange your visa in plenty of time.</p>
<p>Depending on your nationality, you may also require a Schengen and Turkish visa. It is your responsibility to research and arrange this.</p>
