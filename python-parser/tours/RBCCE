on tour</name><description><p>You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>The price is per person based on two people sharing a room. If you are a solo passenger you will share with another group member of the same sex. A single supplement is available if you would like your own room.</p></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>Packing for Carnival</p>
<p>Rio Carnival takes places in the middle of summer so temperatures will likely be hot and humid. There is no strict dress code for Carnival however most people celebrate by wearing bright makeup, face-paint, glitter and feathers!</p>
<p>Clothing</p>
<ul>
<li>Your choice of clothing. Dresses, shorts, skirts etc</li>
<li>Sunscreen</li>
<li>Comfortable shoes that you don't mind getting dirty</li>
<li>A cheap pair of sunglasses - in case you lose them in the party</li>
<li>A bikini which you can wear under clothes. This makes it easier for heading to the beach to cool off after the parties</li>
</ul></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in South America</h5>
<p>South America is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Altitude Sickness</h5>
<p>All clients warrant and accept that there is a chance they may get some form of altitude sickness on itineraries that generally travel to altitudes over 2,400 metres though Tucan Travel will not expose clients to any undue risk of altitude sickness. Tucan Travel tour leaders, staff and local suppliers working at higher altitudes will have some level of knowledge and / or training on how to help and advise you. Please read the information contained <a href="high-altitude-sickness">here</a> to ensure you understand the risks and what to do in this event.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible. Please read our comprehensive guide <a href="about-us/responsible-travel/">here</a> before you travel.</p></description></item><item><name>Joining your tour in Rio de Janeiro </name><description><p>Hotel Regina<br /> Rua Ferreira Viana 29,&amp;nbsp;<br /> Flamengo, <br /> Rio de Janeiro</p>
<p>Tel: +55-21-3289 9999<br /> www.hotelregina.com.br</p>
<p>Your hotel is subject to change. Please refer to your tour voucher for final information.</p>
<p>The hotel has safe deposit boxes for your use.&amp;nbsp;Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you. It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major South American cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h4>Arriving in Rio de Janeiro</h4>
<p>On arrival in Rio de Janeiro, we recommend you change enough money into the local currency (real) for at least the first four or five days of your trip, especially if you are arriving on a Saturday night.</p>
<p>The exchange rate at the airport is just as good as in the city centre. There is the 24-hour Banco do Brasil on the third floor which will give cash advances with visa cards (also has ATMs). Please note that this bank gives better rates than the Cambio on the first floor of the international arrivals area.</p>
<h4>Airport Transfers</h4>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h4>Making your own way</h4>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel,&amp;nbsp;you can either take a taxi from the rank outside or you buy a ticket at one of the pre-pay taxi desks just after you get out of the customs/luggage hall. You then hand your ticket to the driver rather than paying in the taxi. Licensed and unlicensed taxis are available outside but you will have to haggle for a good price which can be difficult if you do not speak Portuguese. It is also best to get them to write down the price (be clear on whether they are talking about Reals or US dollars). The airport is approximately 45 minutes from the city centre (depending on traffic) and the cost of a taxi to our hotel in Rio de Janeiro should be approximately US$20.</p></description></item></tripNotes><whatYouShouldExpect><p>We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.</p>
<p>Your Sambadrome ticket for Sector 13 is included in this package.</p>
<p>While there is not a tour leader included in this package, we will have Tucan Travel staff that will be available for a few hours each day at the hotel for any questions or to help book day trips - always nice to have a friendly face in a new busy city.</p>
<p>During Carnival in Rio de Janeiro most museums are closed, also ATMs can sometimes run out of cash. Try to get out cash when you first arrive.</p></whatYouShouldExpect></tour>
