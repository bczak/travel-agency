The city's residents, Portenos ("people from the port"), are passionate and friendly.</p><p>There are many very different neighbourhoods that make up this cosmopolitan city and each have an identity all their own. The city is easy to negotiate by public transport and it is lovely to cycle around. Check out what the city has to offer on your doorstep or jump on the metro to explore further afield. Buenos Aires is a food lover?s heaven with cuisine from all over the world; Italian food in particular is very good. Of course most people know Argentina for its steaks, and Parrillas (steakhouses) sit on practically every corner.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Next you will continue along the fashionable Avenida de Mayo and the dynamic Avenida Corrientes to the final stop and end of this trip which is Puerto Madero, a busy gastronomic and entertainment area with many restaurants and bars to choose from.</p><p>This evening you will head out to watch Argentina's most famous dance, the passionate and dramatic Tango.
