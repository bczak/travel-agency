The palace complex has several impressive buildings such as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Just walking around this vast area will give you an idea of the spectacular Thai architecture and vibrant colours. Another must see is the temple of Wat Pho, which houses the impressive reclining Buddha. The position of the Buddha represents entry into Nirvana and the end of reincarnations and is an important symbol for Thai people.</p><p>Perhaps spend time soaking up the culture and art scene in one of the many museums dotted around the city. For history buffs, you could easily spend hours soaking up the information in the National Museum, which was Thailand's only museum until the mid 1970?s and has a large and very impressive collection. The Bangkok Art and Culture Centre is a work of art in itself, and you can explore the exhibits which range from photographs to paintings. The Tonson Gallery is excellent for those interested in contemporary art, while the Baan Kamthieng House Museum is perfect for learning more about rural life in Thailand.</p><p>For some of the most impressive city skylines, Bangkok has a huge host of rooftop bars waiting to be enjoyed. For some luxury, head to the ones located in Sukhumvit. You can also enjoy city views by walking to the top of Phu Khao Thong, or The Golden Mountain. The area is a small jungle oasis in the centre of Bangkok and perfect if you need away from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at New Siam II or similar .

</description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cooler depending on the season you are travelling, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus a thinner sweater which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, Southeast Asia is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong for this. When packing, please consider that any included flights on your tour have a luggage weight restriction of 20kg.</p>

<h5>Laundry</h5>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p>
<h5>E-Cigarettes</h5>
<p>Please be aware that many countries in Southeast Asia have banned the use of e-cigarettes and it is not possible to bring them into the country with you. Please check regulations before you depart.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the That baht.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Southeast Asia will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. In general, Southeast Asia is a cheap destination.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of Southeast Asian culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of Asian cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<h5>Breakfast on tour</h5>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box with a few simple pieces to keep you going. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local noodles or congee.</p>
<h5>Vegetarian Food</h5>
<p>Finding vegetarian or vegan food in Southeast Asia is surprisingly easy, especially in the bigger towns and cities. As long as you do some research it is easy to find vegan restaurants in larger cities. Southeast Asian cuisine uses an abundance of noodles, rice and fresh vegetables, so you won&amp;rsquo;t be stuck for something to eat.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>Southeast Asia is known for possibly having the best street food scene in the world. From delicious Thai noodles to the more acquired taste of fried spiders in Cambodia, there is a lot to get your teeth around. Eating at local markets is a great way to experience authentic food and at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p>
<p>Overall Southeast Asia has a fantastic food scene and it should not be missed!</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>

<h5>Safety in Southeast Asia</h5>
<p>Southeast Asia is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<p>Travel Insurance</p>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<p>Pack a Medical Kit</p>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<p>Vaccinations</p>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera, Diphtheria and influenza. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling. It is also a good idea to be vaccinated against rabies if you will be coming into contact with animals.</p>
<p>Horse Riding</p>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
