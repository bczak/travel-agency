The lake itself is known for its deep blue colour and surrounding mountain ranges, which is why it’s often nicknamed by locals as the ‘blue-eyed beauty’. We then drive on to the town of Dilijan, which is dubbed the ‘Switzerland of Armenia’. As we pass through the city, we visit the Sharaberyan Street which is considered the symbol of ‘The old Dilijan’ for its artistic workshops and small rustic shops selling souvenirs and traditional objects.</p><p>We then visit two more prominent monasteries in the area, Sanahin and Haghpat. The medieval Sanahin Monastery is comprised with several churches and chapels and was founded in the 10th century. When literally translated from Armenian, Sanahin means “this one is older than that one” presumably because of the assumption it is older than the nearby monastery of Haghpat. They are both masterpieces of religious architecture and are therefore both listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites.</p><p>We then make our way back to the border and are reunited with our Georgian guide, before returning to Tbilisi for a final night.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at ZP Hotel or Brigitte Hotel or similar .

<p>Roads in Georgia and Armenia can be quite winding at times. If you are prone to motion sickness please bring appropriate medication.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the Georgian lari and the Armenian dram.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Georgia and Armenia will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card. It is always suggested to have a small supply of cash should you require it, especially if you are visiting remote areas.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. In general, Georgia and Armenia are not expensive holiday destinations.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is a big part of European culture, and while it is much more prominent in Western Europe it is still expected in most of the Eastern Europe countries. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><h5>Luggage</h5>
<p>You will be carrying your own luggage on tour. Please limit this to one piece per person plus one day bag.</p>
<p>It is important to bring luggage you can carry and lift comfortably, potentially up several flights of stairs in hotels where elevators are not available and between bus/train stations and hotels.</p>
<h5>Packing List</h5>
<p>Please consider which season you are travelling in and pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<p>Good, comfortable walking shoes are essential. There can either be comfortable trainers or walking shoes. You will find you walk a lot in Europe, sometimes on uneven and cobbled streets.</p>
<p>In general, Europe is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong to cover up for this.</p>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost unless included in the itinerary. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>

<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to meeting your tour please call (+44) 788 7498 617.</p>
<h5>Safety in Europe</h5>
<p>Europe is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h5>Scams in Europe</h5>
<p>Unfortunately there are many common scams occurring regularly across Europe. While these are normally harmless to your personal safety, they can leave you losing money. The most common are people approaching you seemingly offering a gift, to then turn around and ask for money, children distracting you while someone goes through your bag, people pretending to be stranded/lost/mugged and asking you for money or people asking you to sign a fake charity petition, while someone else dips into your pocket. Pickpocket gangs often work in teams, so while one bumps into you and fumbles around apologising, another might be searching for a wallet. These scams are easily avoided by keeping your bag zipped at all times and on your front in crowds, and using your common sense when someone approaches you.</p>
<h5>Traffic and crossing the road</h5>
<p>Traffic is Europe can be hectic. You should always look both ways before crossing the road, depending on the country they might drive on the other side of the road. Rules on jaywalking can vary between countries, so we suggest always using pedestrian and zebra crossings.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
