On one side of the village, rivers and waterways allow you to paddle deep into the jungle and experience the natural world in peace. When you arrive at your lodge, you will check in and relax, listening to the sounds of the wildlife or just soak up the laidback atmosphere in town.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Nestled between two primary cloud forest reserves, the high altitude of the town, some 1440 metres above sea level, results in a steady supply of clouds. The moisture from these clouds catches on the branches of the tallest trees and drips down to the other organisms below, supporting a complex and far-reaching ecosystem. Over 100 species of mammals, thousands of insect species and over 2500 varieties of plants all thrive here. Once you have checked in to your hotel, the remainder of the day is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
