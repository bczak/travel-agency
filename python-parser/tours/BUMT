'This is Burma' he wrote, 'and it is quite unlike any place you know about!' Destroyed by a fire and heavily bombed during World War II, the Burma of old is more difficult to find but when you do, it astounds you.</p><p>With a turbulent history, after thousands were killed in a military uprising, Burma changed its name to Myanmar in 1989. Myanmar today has only recently opened its border to travellers after the Military Junta, which was in control since 1962 and dissolved after years of internal struggle as recently as 2011. As this largely rural country remains unaffected by long term tourism it offers us a wonderful insight into Southeast Asian life.</p><p>A highlight it to visit the Mahamuni Pagoda with its old Buddha statue. Typically a lively temple, men put gold leaves into the statue. Here you can also shop around for the perfect souvenir, your own small statue made of bronze or wood. If you can't find what you are looking for, the marble carving street should have a treat in store. Walking through the Mahagandayon monastery complex, see hundreds of monks heading to prayers.</p><p>Tonight, you can visit the Yadanar night market to get a feel for the real Mandalay. Grab some traditional snacks before enjoying a beer at a famous beer station and a delicious meal at one of Mandalay's traditional BBQ restaurants.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Oway Grand Hotel or similar .

Bagan is home to more Buddhist temples than anywhere in the world. They poke out of the trees and have a graceful aging process. It is here that the sunsets are some of the best in the world.</p><p>On arrival, we enjoy a half day guided orientation tour of the area where you will see some of the best temples in the region. Discover Ananda, Sulamani, and Thatbyinnyu, the latter being one of the highest monuments in Bagan.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Staying at Hotel Umbra or similar .

The flat landscape makes a bike tour an easy excursion and your guide will show you some of the most spectacular ancient temples away from the crowds. Cycle through the palm trees and bamboo huts finding temples and ruins along the way.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon is free to further explore. You can visit Mount Popa, the birthplace of the 37 'nats' of Myanmar which are the protective spirits. Or you could get further off the beaten track by visiting rural villages as well as fruit and flower markets.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Staying at Hotel Umbra or similar .

A community project only recently established here, it protects the jungle, the wildlife that resides in it and the traditions of the local people living in the area. The project also protects some of Myanmar?s endangered elephants which, without this protection, may have been hunted down and killed or sold into the tourism trade.</p><p>These elephants are retired from working life and we will have the opportunity to wash and feed the elephants but riding them is strictly not allowed. Returning to the camp, we will enjoy lunch before continuing our journey to Kalaw. Travelling by private vehicle gives us the opportunity to make multiple stops on the way to Kalaw in local villages. We can learn how to make toddy and jaggery (palm sugar) from the sap of the toddy palm.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Dream Villa Hotel or similar .

This scenic journey travels through the Shan mountains and you can glimpse the local life as you travel en route. The train has been used by locals and westerners alike for over 100 years and has a distinctive colonial feel to it. This train can't be pre-booked so you may be seated in the 'ordinary class' giving you a real taste of how locals travel by train.</p><p>Arriving at Inle Lake in the early afternoon, there is time to enjoy a peaceful afternoon by the lake. Tomorrow we will enjoy a full day excursion to experience all the area has to offer.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Maine Li or similar .

We visit floating gardens, pass some of the fishermen who row their boats using their legs, balancing precariously on the other. One of the main highlights of the excursion is the lunch made by a local family. You will experience authentic Intha food including the famous tomato salad, meat cakes steamed in banana leaves and more. You will also visit traditional markets in different villages depending on the day we travel. If time allows, we will also visit a cheroot factory where Burmese cigars are made, floating tomato gardens, Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda and Intha Heritage House where Burmese cats are bred.</p><p>Well known for its weaving, on Inle Lake we have the chance to purchase souvenirs including the Burmese tote-bags and high quality silk fabrics. You can also try traditional Shan cuisine including Htamin Jin, a delicious meal of rice, tomato, potato or fish in round balls, wrapped in crisp fried onion and marinated in garlic.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Maine Li or similar .

Despite being a city, here it is common to see locals walking down the street barefoot with natural sunblock from the Thanaka tree rubbed on their faces. There is plenty to do in this bustling city from food tours, local markets, lakes and pagodas.</p><p>The largest and most beautiful pagoda in the area is the Shwedagon Pagoda and it is also the most religion site in Myanmar. It was originally built in the 6th century AD and has been rebuilt and developed over time to become the sprawling, golden site of today. It is also a meeting point for locals. You can experience the local hustle and bustle of the area while it is also possible to pick up some souvenirs from the shops outside the site.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Clover City Centre Hotel or similar .

Arriving to the hotel in the evening you could explore the various night markets that are dotted around or visit the bars and restaurants in the area. There is something for every taste in this city - from quirky live music venues to high end rooftop bars.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at New Siam II or similar .

There are over 15,000 stalls offering anything and everything that you could dream of. Mingle with the locals and immerse yourself in the bustle of vendors and shoppers going about their daily lives.</p><p>You could take your own street food walking tour, enjoying delicacies from the many vendors dotted around the city. Foods to look out for include green papaya salad, Thai fried rice, Pad thai and pork skewers. You could even take a Thai cookery course and learn more about the secrets behind these mouth watering foods.</p><p>One of the biggest highlights of the city and a must see is the opulent Grand Palace, which was built in 1782 and was home of the Thai King for over 150 years. The palace complex has several impressive buildings such as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Just walking around this vast area will give you an idea of the spectacular Thai architecture and vibrant colours. Another must see is the temple of Wat Pho, which houses the impressive reclining Buddha. The position of the Buddha represents entry into Nirvana and the end of reincarnations and is an important symbol for Thai people.</p><p>For some of the most impressive city skylines, Bangkok has a huge host of rooftop bars waiting to be enjoyed. For some luxury, head to the ones located in Sukhumvit. You can also enjoy city views by walking to the top of Phu Khao Thong, or The Golden Mountain. The area is a small jungle oasis in the centre of Bangkok and perfect if you need away from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at New Siam II or similar .

We disembark at Wat Pho and visit the famous reclining Buddha.</p><p>This afternoon perhaps spend time soaking up the culture and art scene in one of the many museums dotted around the city. For history buffs, you could easily spend hours soaking up the information in the National Museum, which was Thailand's only museum until the mid 1970?s and has a large and very impressive collection. The Bangkok Art and Culture Centre is a work of art in itself, and you can explore the exhibits which range from photographs to paintings. The Tonson Gallery is excellent for those interested in contemporary art, while the Baan Kamthieng House Museum is perfect for learning more about rural life in Thailand.</p><p>In the early evening we will meet our group and tour leader back at the hotel and head to the train station for the overnight train to southern Thailand!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on overnight sleeper trains .

Staying nearby you have the chance to visit the national park and tropical rainforest, which is older than the Amazon Jungle. The area of Khao Sok National Park is an incredible 739 square kilometres, including the 165 square kilometre Cheow Lan Lake. The park is the most biodiverse jungle in Thailand and as well as holding many wild animals has an amazing array of flora and fauna, as well as various bird species. Mammals found in the rainforest include the tapir, Asian elephant, sambar deer, wild boar, white handed gibbons and bears.</p><p>The landscapes are beautiful, with lush jungle complimented with breath-taking limestone cliffs and hidden waterfalls. It is also home to the rare Rafflesia Kerrii, the world's largest flower. Khao Sok is the only place in Thailand to find it.</p><p>After an orientation of the surrounding area you are free to explore the park or simply wander around the breathtaking area. While the area is rural and tranquil, there are various restaurants and hotels in the area serving fresh and good quality local food.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Nature Place or similar .

A great way to experience this is to hire a local guide who can talk you through the animals that live in the area and show you the best places to see in the rainforest.</p><p>Caves in the area, such as Diamond Cave, Khang Cow Cave and Nam Talu Cave, all connect to the lake and can be explored on a boat trip.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Nature Place or similar .

Thailand's largest island, Phuket offers some of the country's most popular beaches and is located close to popular islands including James Bond Island (Khao Phing Kan) or Racha Island (Ko Racha Yai) famed for its diving and snorkelling.</p><p>We hop on a private minibus and travel for around three hours to reach our hotel in Phuket. The rest of the afternoon is free to start enjoying the sunshine filled beaches and glistening waters. The hardest decision of today will be whether you snorkel or paddle board first!</p><p>Phuket comes alive at night with various restaurants, bars and live music venues. From all night laser nightclubs to laid back beach bars, there is something for every taste and every budget on the island. The food choices are endless, you could enjoy the fresh seafood on offer or the various small eateries serving up typical Thai dishes. Your tour leader will be able to recommend the best ones.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at 99 Residence Patong or similar .

Thailand's famed islands have been the set for many films over the years and hold a certain mystique. Take a boat trip and explore as many as your heart desires or snorkel around the bays amongst stunning exotic fish and other marine animals.</p><p>Of course beaches and islands are not to everyone's taste, so why not visit the historical Old Phuket Town, small enough to stroll around but with an abundance of differing cultural histories. See the Big Buddha, a white, 45 metre tall effigy of Buddha with 360 degree views of the island. Wat Chalong is one of the most significant temples on the island and is beautifully decorated with many shimmering pieces on the pagodas.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at 99 Residence Patong or similar .

<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>

<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>To get from Mandalay airport to the joining hotel, you can find a Taxi Counter in the arrivals terminal, where you can buy a coupon for the taxi - there is a set price for each destination so there are so scams.

Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cooler depending on the season you are travelling, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus a thinner sweater which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, Southeast Asia is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong for this. When packing, please consider that any included flights on your tour have a luggage weight restriction of 20kg.</p>

<h5>Laundry</h5>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p>
<h5>E-Cigarettes</h5>
<p>Please be aware that many countries in Southeast Asia have banned the use of e-cigarettes and it is not possible to bring them into the country with you. Please check regulations before you depart.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the Burmese kyat and the Thai baht.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Southeast Asia will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. In general, Southeast Asia is a cheap destination.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of Southeast Asian culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p>
</description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<h5>Breakfast on tour</h5>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box with a few simple pieces to keep you going. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a local breakfast.</p>
<h5>Vegetarian Food</h5>
<p>Finding vegetarian or vegan food in Southeast Asia is surprisingly easy, especially in the bigger towns and cities. As long as you do some research it is easy to find vegan restaurants in larger cities. Southeast Asian cuisine uses an abundance of noodles, rice and fresh vegetables, so you won&amp;rsquo;t be stuck for something to eat.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>Bangkok is known for possibly having the best street food scene in the world. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance before meeting your tour please call (+66) 633 21 0066.</p>
<h5>Safety in Myanmar and Thailand</h5>
<p>Southeast Asia is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera, Diphtheria and influenza. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling. It is also a good idea to be vaccinated against rabies if you will be coming into contact with animals.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
