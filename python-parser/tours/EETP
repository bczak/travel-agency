You are free to arrive at your leisure. We highly recommend booking pre tour accommodation or arriving on an early flight so that you can fully explore this beautiful city.</p><p>Famous for its enchanting historic centre, the city is a popular holiday destination on the Gulf of Finland. Roam the cobbled streets and explore scenic ruins or climb the hill of Toompea, which is filled with medieval buildings, 14th century churches, turrets, spires and enticing alleyways.</p><p>Estonia has a long and fascinating history, having been inhabited since at least 9000 B.C. It has been ruled by Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles and Russians, with the more distinctive Estonian identity coming to light in the late 19th century. During World War II, Estonia was ultimately incorporated into the Soviet Union after years of contest, which lead to years of communist rule. On August 20th, 1991, Estonia gained its independence.</p><p>Modern day Estonia is progressive and traditional all in one. In 2005, they became the first country to hold elections over the internet, and in 2014 the first country to make e-residency possible. The city of Tallinn has been listed as one of the most digitally advanced in the world, with the likes of Skype emerging from the small city. Nevertheless, the old quarter of Tallinn is one of the most charming and other wordly corners of Europe!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Economy Hotel or similar .

The capital of Lithuania, Vilnius boasts an attractive baroque Old Town ,which is the largest in Eastern Europe and is praised as the 'New Prague'. Located on the edge of the Neris River, with its pine covered hills, friendly people, and blend of old and new, this is a picturesque city well worth exploring. You will have time to explore the main sights of the city including Gediminas Castle on the top of Gediminas Hill and Cathedral Square at the base of the hill, which is dominated by Vilnius Cathedral and its 57 metre-tall belfry.</p><p>While you're exploring the square between the cathedral and the tower you should hunt for the secret stebuklas (miracle) tile. The tile marks the southern end of the 2 million person, 650 kilometre long human chain between Tallinn and Vilnius, which was formed in protest against Soviet occupation in 1989. Local legend has it that if you find the pretty mosaic-covered tile you should stand on it and turn around three times clockwise while making a wish, which shall then be granted.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Panorama or similar .

<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>

<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Europe will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. In general, Eastern Europe is much cheaper than Western Europe.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is a big part of European culture, and while it is much more prominent in Western Europe it is still expected in most of the Eastern Europe countries. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Free Walking Tours</h5>
<p>Free walking tours are found in almost every destination throughout Europe, especially in the larger cities where you will find a few companies offering the same tour. These are marketed as free walking tours and are designed to provide travellers with local, in depth knowledge of the city. However all free walking tours are tip based (they have to make money somehow, after all!) and so if you wish to join a free walking tour you need to budget in a tip at the end. Depending on how much you enjoyed the tour, anything from 5EUR to 20EUR is appropriate. Leaving a free walking tour that was considered a good tour without tipping is very disrespectful and will only give travellers a bad reputation.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund. With so much on offer your budget in Europe can vary a lot, but we suggest a bare minimum of 25EUR per day in Eastern Europe and the Balkans and a minimum of 35EUR per day in Central Europe, Slovenia and Croatia.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of European cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Food in Europe differs between countries. In Eastern and Central Europe, the standard diet is mostly meat based. Vegetarians will have options but may find themselves more limited than back home. Vegans and those on a gluten free diet will find it more challenging and you might need to pick up your own supplies at a supermarket.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>

<h5>Safety in Europe</h5>
<p>Europe is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h5>Scams in Europe</h5>
<p>Unfortunately there are many common scams occurring regularly across Europe. While these are normally harmless to your personal safety, they can leave you losing money. The most common are people approaching you seemingly offering a gift, to then turn around and ask for money, children distracting you while someone goes through your bag, people pretending to be stranded/lost/mugged and asking you for money or people asking you to sign a fake charity petition, while someone else dips into your pocket. Pickpocket gangs often work in teams, so while one bumps into you and fumbles around apologising, another might be searching for a wallet. These scams are easily avoided by keeping your bag zipped at all times and on your front in crowds, and using your common sense when someone approaches you.</p>
<h5>Traffic and crossing the road</h5>
<p>Traffic is Europe can be hectic. You should always look both ways before crossing the road, depending on the country they might drive on the other side of the road. Rules on jaywalking can vary between countries, so we suggest always using pedestrian and zebra crossings.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.

<p>This tour is modular and made up of two smaller sections. This means there will be people leaving and joining in Warsaw. You will have one tour leader from Tallinn to Warsaw and another down to Prague.</p>
<p>Europe is cobbled streets, winding staircases and lots of walking. You will need a decent fitness level to fully enjoy this trip.</p>
<p>This trip uses a range of public buses and trains. You will be responsible for carrying your luggage at all times, on and off transport and sometimes up stairs, or along cobbled streets. You MUST ensure you can comfortably carry it, and keep to one piece of luggage and one small bag.</p>
<p>Hotel rooms in Europe tend to be much smaller than in America, Canada or Australia. Double beds are sometimes two single beds pushed together.</p>
<p>We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.</p>
<p>This area of Europe can still be very cold in the shoulder months. Ensure you bring appropriate clothing.</p>
