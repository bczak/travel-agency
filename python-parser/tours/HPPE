While the drive is long, the scenery is beautiful and we will make regular stops for bathrooms and viewpoints.</p><p>Complete with jaw-dropping landscapes and emerald forests, the area is an internationally recognised UNESCO World Heritage site. Located on the Chilean side of Patagonia, it measures an astonishing 181 000 hectares. The area is home to various animals including condors,  huemul (South Andean deer), and the llamas closest cousin, the guanaco. Once endangered, around 3000 now call the vast park their home and you will be sure to see a few on your walks.</p><p>Upon arrival, we will settle into the campsite and our team will show you how to set up the tents. You are then free to walk around the area, taking in all the natural beauty. We recommend walking down to the lake where on a clear day, offers spectacular views of the mountains.</p><p>Please Note: We camp for three nights in Torres del Paine National Park. Solo travellers will share a tent with a group member of the same sex. Facilities are basic however there is an inside bar, small shop, 24/7 hot water and proper toilets. We recommend bringing a portable battery pack for your devices for these days, however the truck does also have USB charging points. If you don't have your own sleeping bag you can rent one from your Tour Leader for $40 USD, depending on availability. If you would like a sleeping bag set aside for you please speak with your adventures specialist. All meals are included while camping including a three course dinner.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) camping at Camping Pehoe or similar .

There are many guided walks on offer which showcase the best of the national park and where you can witness some amazing mountain views.</p><p>Some of the walks are quite demanding, and at a high altitude, but there are a good range of options for all grades of walkers. One such trek offers incredible views of the famous ‘towers’, the three distinctive granite peaks of the Paine mountain range. It’s quite challenging, with the whole route being 19km, however it is well worth it. For the longer treks such as the “towers” walk, a reasonable level of fitness is required and passengers must be prepared for all weather conditions. We recommend packing trekking boots, waterproof trousers and a positive outlook to all weather!</p><p>Come evening, relax in one of the most peaceful places on earth as you enjoy time with your group and fellow travellers in the camps.

The spectacular ice formation is around 30 kilometres in length and fed by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the third largest reserve of freshwater in the world. While many glaciers worldwide are currently decreasing in size, the Perito Moreno glacier is gaining just as much ice as it looses so retains its impressive size and formation.</p><p>Named after Argentine explorer Francisco Merino, the glacier is coloured in a variety of hues from blue to grey to white and continually creaks and cracks. Advancing at a speed of around two metres per day, it can put on a spectacular show when giant chunks of ice at the outermost edges crack under tremendous pressure, rupture and crash into the water – a process known as calving. You will have the chance to walk around some paths and terraces where you can get some great views of the glacier.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hostels at Glaciar del Libertador or similar .

While on the truck enjoy some of the best views as you journey through the wilderness, stopping at Mount Fitz Roy for some spectacular photo opportunities. This grand mountain stands on the border between Chile and Argentina, with a large part close to the summit remaining undefined as to which country it belongs to.</p><p>Arriving in El Chalten, you will feel immersed in the unspoiled nature that surrounds you. Founded in 1985, the small town has fantastic views of the mountains that shadow over it, and was even named Argentina’s Trekking Capital.</p><p>Spend the rest of the evening enjoying the town and dine in one of the many quaint restaurants. For such a small place there is a surprising amount on offer from local delicacies to other foods from all over Argentina.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Kalenshen or similar .

Our local expert guide for the day will meet us at our hotel and get us ready for today’s hike, an alternative to the traditional hike to the Fitz Roy viewpoint. Our exploration of the natural beauty of Los Glaciares National Park starts with a 40-minute transfer to El Pilar, heading north out of El Chalten, via the road leading to Lago del Desierto (Desert Lake).</p><p>Form here we start trekking along the Rio Blanco gently ascending from 500m to 800m altitude until we arrive at the Poincenot camp. On the way we will pass the Piedras Blancas Glacier viewpoint and the Piedras Blancas Lagoon as well as the Valley del Marconi and the entrance to the southern ice field. With our legs warmed up nicely, we start a steep 1km climb of rocky steps with little vegetation around to protect us from the Patagonian wind. While physically demanding, the views that receive us at the top are some of the most impressive in Patagonia. From here, on a clear day, we can see the entire Fitz Roy Massif, the Laguna de los Tres, Glacier de los Tres as well as both Laguna Sucia and Glacier Sucio, a spectacular sight. After a quick lunch, weather permitting, we begin the hour descent to Rio Blanco again before joining the traditional route straight down to El Chalten.</p><p>If you do not wish to do the Laguna de los Tres hike there are various other options available from El Chalten.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Kalenshen or similar .

your tour</name><description><h5>Physical Rating</h5>
<p>This tour has a three star physical rating for the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Walking involved / Difficult terrain:</strong> This tour is centred around Patagonia. While the hikes are all optional it is recommended to have a reasonable level of fitness to fully enjoy the experience. The longest hike is 22km and will take around 10 hours return with some uphill sections.</p>
<p><strong>Pace of tour:</strong> This tour is packed with activities and excursions and moves at a relatively fast pace, spending an average of 2 nights in each location, but sometimes more or less.</p>
<p>Please speak to us if you have any concerns about physical restrictions.</p>
<h5>Travelling on a group tour/solo travellers</h5>
<p>Travelling on a group tour is a fantastic way to see the world whilst meeting people from different walks of life. Many people who meet on group tours become friends for life! Due to the nature of group travel, there are a few things to consider when planning your trip. Patience can sometimes be required to accommodate different needs of the group and we always ask you to stick to travel and meeting times, so the rest of the group do not suffer.</p>
<p>Our Tour Leaders sometimes like to encourage group meals - however, if you prefer being more independent you are also free to do your own thing.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about who is in your group on a particular departure, our Adventure Specialists will be able to advise on ages and demographics.</p>
<h5>Solo Travellers</h5>
<p>Over 60% of our passengers are solo travellers and all of our group tours are priced per person on a shared room basis (unless otherwise stated) meaning there is no compulsory extra payment for those travelling on their own.</p>
<p>You will be roomed with someone of the same gender who is also travelling solo.</p>
<h5>Tour Leader/Driver - what to expect</h5>
<p>This tour includes a Tucan Travel tour leader and driver as well as local mountain guides on some excursions.</p>
<p>The Tucan Travel tour leader will accompany you throughout the tour, leading the group from A to B and providing information and knowledge on the places visited. Your tour leader will speak English and is there to ensure the smooth running of the tour. Your tour leader will bond the group, arrange group meals, assist with daily issues and take care of all the logistics - meaning all you have to worry about is enjoying your trip of a lifetime!</p>
<p>Our tours are not hand-held tours - once settled into a location you will be given the flexibility to explore on your own, with the aid of the group leader advising on what to see and do in the area.</p></description></item><item><name>Joining your tour in Punta Arenas</name><description><p>Your joining location is: <br />Hotel Savoy <br /> Jos&amp;eacute; Men&amp;eacute;ndez 1073, <br />Punta Arenas <br />Regi&amp;oacute;n de Magallanes y de la Ant&amp;aacute;rtica Chilena <br />Chile</p>
<h5>Arriving in Punta Arenas</h5>

You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<p><strong>Torres del Paine National Park</strong> - We camp for three nights in Torres del Paine National Park. Solo travellers will share a tent with a group member of the same sex. Facilities are basic however there is an inside bar, small shop, (limited) hot water and proper toilets. We recommend bringing a portable battery pack for your devices for these days, however the truck does also have charging points. If you don't have your own sleeping bag you can rent one from your Tour Leader for $40 USD, depending on availability. If you would like a sleeping bag set aside for you please speak with your adventures specialist. All meals are included while camping including a three course dinner.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses the Tucan Travel Overland Truck. You can read more about our trucks <a href="overland-holidays">here</a></p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport.</p>
<h5>Approximate travel times on this trip</h5>
<p>The below information provides approximate travel times and modes of transport for your tour. Please note that modes of transport may be subject to change depending on the group size and timings may vary depending on the season and border crossings on the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Punta Arenas to Torres del Paine National Park - 7 hours by Overland Truck</li>
<li>Torres del Paine National Park to El Calafate - 7 hours by Overland Truck</li>
<li>El Calafate to El Chalten - 3 hours by Overland Truck</li>
</ul></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses two different currencies. It is worth bearing in mind that some of the countries will accept US dollars but they will give you change in their local currency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chilean Peso</li>
<li>Argentinian Peso</li>
</ul>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card. During the summer season ATMs in places like El Chalten and El Calafate can run out of money fast. You should ensure you take enough cash for the duration of your stay. Most restaurants in the town&amp;rsquo;s of Patagonia will accept credit cards.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is part of life in South America. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>Patagonia is known for its unpredictable weather and so you should always be prepared with waterproofs as well as sunglasses/hats. Nights can be cold in some locations, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<h5>Flights</h5>
<p>If your tour includes internal flights please be aware there is often a restriction of 15kg for checked baggage. If your luggage exceeds this weight you will need to pay any fees incurred.</p>
<p>What essential items should I bring to Patagonia?</p>
<ul>

<li>Good, comfortable walking shoes or boots are essential for the hikes on uneven terrain.</li>

<li>Layers - We recommend packing lightweight and durable clothes which you can layer.</li>

Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms. There will be no laundry facilities when camping in Torres del Paine National park.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location.

<h5>Safety in South America</h5>
<p>South America is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Altitude Sickness</h5>
<p>All clients warrant and accept that there is a chance they may get some form of altitude sickness on itineraries that generally travel to altitudes over 2,400 metres though Tucan Travel will not expose clients to any undue risk of altitude sickness. Tucan Travel tour leaders, staff and local suppliers working at higher altitudes will have some level of knowledge and / or training on how to help and advise you. Please read the information contained <a href="high-altitude-sickness">here</a> to ensure you understand the risks and what to do in this event.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip.
