You are free to arrive today at your leisure and start enjoying all that Moscow has to offer.</p><p>Golden onion domes and towering skyscrapers, cosy cafes and hushed churches, Russia's capital city is beautiful, atmospheric and overflowing with history. There is plenty to see and do here, including numerous cathedrals, museums, art galleries, palaces, the State History Museum and the iconic St Basil's Cathedral, towers and monuments. We highly recommend arriving in Moscow a day or so earlier to make the most of this fascinating city.</p><p>Moscow's Red Square (Krasnaya Ploshad) is the main centre of the city and was a market place during the fifteenth century. The red part of its name does not refer to Communism or to the colour of the stone (which is actually grey) but derives from the old Russian word krasniy meaning beautiful. During the Soviet regime the square was known for its May Day parades and is the site of Lenin's Mausoleum.</p><p>It is said that soon after January 21, 1924, the day that Vladimir Lenin died, the Soviet government received more than 10,000 telegrams from all over Russia, which asked the government to preserve his body somehow for future generations. Lenin's tomb, and final resting place, was then promptly set about being designed and a wooden tomb was constructed within 6 days of his death. A larger mausoleum was constructed later that year and stands today in the centre of the city in the prominent Red Square.</p><p>There will be a pre departure meeting held in your hotel at 6pm tonight. Please check reception for details.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Izmailovo Gamma or similar .

Roam the cobbled streets and explore scenic ruins or climb the hill of Toompea, which is filled with medieval buildings, 14th century churches, turrets, spires and enticing alleyways.</p><p>Estonia has a long and fascinating history, having been inhabited since at least 9000 B.C. It has been ruled by Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles and Russians, with the more distinctive Estonian identity coming to light in the late 19th century. During World War II, Estonia was ultimately incorporated into the Soviet Union after years of contest, which lead to years of communist rule. On August 20th, 1991, Estonia gained its independence.</p><p>Modern day Estonia is progressive and traditional all in one. In 2005, they became the first country to hold elections over the internet, and in 2014 the first country to make e-residency possible. The city of Tallinn has been listed as one of the most digitally advanced in the world, with the likes of Skype emerging from the small city. Nevertheless, the old quarter of Tallinn is one of the most charming and other wordly corners of Europe!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Economy Hotel or similar .

You will have time to explore the main sights of the city including Gediminas Castle on the top of Gediminas Hill and Cathedral Square at the base of the hill, which is dominated by Vilnius Cathedral and its 57 metre-tall belfry.</p><p>While you're exploring the square between the cathedral and the tower you should hunt for the secret stebuklas (miracle) tile. The tile marks the southern end of the 2 million person, 650 kilometre long human chain between Tallinn and Vilnius, which was formed in protest against Soviet occupation in 1989. Local legend has it that if you find the pretty mosaic-covered tile you should stand on it and turn around three times clockwise while making a wish, which shall then be granted.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Panorama or similar .

your tour in Moscow</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Hotel Gamma Delta @ Izmailovo Hotel Complex<br />Building Gamma<br />71, 4 G-D, Izmailovskoe shosse, <br />Moscow, <br />105613,</p>
<p>Phone: +7 495 737-7000</p>
<p>Below is the address of Hotel Gamma Delta Izmailovo in Cyrillic, helpful for taxi drivers.</p>
<p>Измайлово отель Гамма-Дельта<br />Корпус Гамма, Измайловское шоссе 71 4 Г-Д , Москва</p>
<p><br />The hotels have safe deposit boxes for your use. Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you.</p>
<p>It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Moscow</h5>
<p>When arriving at Domodedovo International Airport (34 kilometres south of Moscow) or Sheremetyevo International Airport (29 kilometres northwest of Moscow), we recommend that you obtain some Russian rubles as soon as you arrive. There are numerous international ATMs inside the airports. The rate will always differ slightly depending on where you go. The airport does offer a decent rate and it may otherwise be inconvenient to find an exchange office open in the city, depending on what time you arrive</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact address below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>

<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel, taxis are available&amp;nbsp;from the airports but you may have problems finding drivers who speak English. The journey&amp;nbsp;should cost approximately 1,500 rubles from airports. The taxi&amp;nbsp;should be on a meter (make sure they start it when you begin your journey) and you pay the driver when you arrive at the hotel. <br /> <br /> Moscow is equidistant from all the airports and the the journeys take approximately an hour depending on Moscow traffic which can be notoriously bad.</p>
<p>As taxis are expensive you may prefer to&amp;nbsp;use public transport where possible:</p>
<p style="clear: left;">To connect to the Metro network from Domodedovo Airport you can take a shuttle bus to Domodedovskaya Metro station. Travel time to Partizanskaya is about two hours.</p>
<p>From Sheremetyevo Airport the No. 851 bus goes to Rechnoy Vokzal Metro station. Travel time to Partizanskaya is about one hour and 20 minutes.</p>
<p>From Vnukovo International Airport, take the Bhykobo Commuter Train in the city and then transfer to the Metro. Travel time is approximately 1 and a half hours.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You must validate your Russia visa within 72 hours of your arrival in each Russian city. This can be done when you check in at your hotel.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a variety of hotels, guesthouses and apartments.

<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. If you wish to book a double bed, please advice your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>
<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on most occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p> 
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport.

<p>Boat Trips and water based activities</p>

<p>It is important to bring luggage you can carry and lift comfortably, potentially up several flights of stairs in hotels where elevators are not available and between bus/train stations and hotels.</p>
<h5>Packing List</h5>
<p>Please consider which season you are travelling in and pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<p>Good, comfortable walking shoes are essential. There can either be comfortable trainers or walking shoes. You will find you walk a lot in Europe, sometimes on uneven and cobbled streets.</p>
<p>In general, Europe is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong to cover up for this.</p>

If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses a total of 4 different currencies. This includes the euro which is used in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. It is worth bearing in mind that many of the below countries will accept euro but they will give you change in their local currency.</p>
<p>Below are the other 3 currencies used on this tour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Russian Ruble</li>
<li>Polish Zloty</li>
<li>Czech Koruna</li>
</ul>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Europe will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. In general, Eastern Europe is much cheaper than Western Europe.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is a big part of European culture, and while it is much more prominent in Western Europe it is still expected in most of the Eastern Europe countries. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Free Walking Tours</h5>
<p>Free walking tours are found in almost every destination throughout Europe, especially in the larger cities where you will find a few companies offering the same tour. These are marketed as free walking tours and are designed to provide travellers with local, in depth knowledge of the city. However all free walking tours are tip based (they have to make money somehow, after all!) and so if you wish to join a free walking tour you need to budget in a tip at the end. Depending on how much you enjoyed the tour, anything from 5EUR to 20EUR is appropriate. Leaving a free walking tour that was considered a good tour without tipping is very disrespectful and will only give travellers a bad reputation.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund. With so much on offer your budget in Europe can vary a lot, but we suggest a bare minimum of 25EUR per day in Eastern Europe and the Balkans and a minimum of 35EUR per day in Central Europe, Slovenia and Croatia.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p>

</description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of European cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Food in Europe differs between countries. In Eastern and Central Europe, the standard diet is mostly meat based. Vegetarians will have options but may find themselves more limited than back home. Vegans and those on a gluten free diet will find it more challenging and you might need to pick up your own supplies at a supermarket.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to meeting your tour please call (+44) 788 7498 617.</p>
<h5>Safety in Europe</h5>
<p>Europe is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h5>Scams in Europe</h5>
<p>Unfortunately there are many common scams occurring regularly across Europe. While these are normally harmless to your personal safety, they can leave you losing money. The most common are people approaching you seemingly offering a gift, to then turn around and ask for money, children distracting you while someone goes through your bag, people pretending to be stranded/lost/mugged and asking you for money or people asking you to sign a fake charity petition, while someone else dips into your pocket. Pickpocket gangs often work in teams, so while one bumps into you and fumbles around apologising, another might be searching for a wallet. These scams are easily avoided by keeping your bag zipped at all times and on your front in crowds, and using your common sense when someone approaches you.</p>
<h5>Traffic and crossing the road</h5>
<p>Traffic is Europe can be hectic. You should always look both ways before crossing the road, depending on the country they might drive on the other side of the road. Rules on jaywalking can vary between countries, so we suggest always using pedestrian and zebra crossings.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible. Please read our comprehensive guide <a href="about-us/responsible-travel/">here</a> before you travel.</p></description></item></tripNotes><whatYouShouldExpect><p>This group tour ranges in size from 4 to 17 people, with an overall average of 10 people.</p>
<p>This tour is modular and made up of two sections. This means there will be people leaving and joining in Tallinn and Warsaw. You will have one tour leader from Moscow to Tallinn and another down to Prague.</p>
<p>Europe is cobbled streets, winding staircases and lots of walking. You will need a decent fitness level to fully enjoy this trip.</p>
<p>This trip uses a range of public buses and trains. You will be responsible for carrying your luggage at all times, on and off transport and sometimes up stairs, or along cobbled streets. You MUST ensure you can comfortably carry it, and keep to one piece of luggage and one small bag.</p>
<p>The local buses used in the Baltic region of this tour are very comfortable with toilets, WI-FI and media screens in the seats.</p>
<p>Hotel rooms in Europe tend to be much smaller than in America, Canada or Australia. Double beds are sometimes two single beds pushed together.</p>
<p>Depending on your nationality, you may also require a Schengen visa. It is your responsibility to research and arrange this.</p>
<p>This tour includes a compulsory Local Payment that needs to be paid to the Tour Leader on Day 1 of your tour. For more information on our Local Payments please click <a href="/our-prices">here</a>.</p></whatYouShouldExpect></tour>
