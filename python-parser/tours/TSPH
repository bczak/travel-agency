The ancient Uros were originally forced to take up residence on the floating islands when the Incas expanded onto their land and the mobility of the islands was a defence mechanism. Totora reed, which is plentiful along the edges of the lake, is used to make homes, furniture, boats and the islands they stand on. As reeds disintegrate from the bottom of the islands, which are four to eight feet thick, residents must add more to the surface. Each island has a collection of simple reed houses but they are not short of modern conveniences such as solar panels and televisions.</p><p>Later you will travel on to Taquile, an island untouched by the mainland\'s modernity. The local inhabitants, known as Taquileños, still wear traditional clothing and are known for their high-quality handicrafts. Since 1970, the islands have been governed by the Taquileños and visitors are greeted by these ancient communities and have the opportunity to share their ways of life. While the women make yarn and weave, knitting is done exclusively by men. Pre-Inca vestiges are found in the highest part of the island. You will return to your hotel in Puno in the afternoon and the evening is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Whilst this is a full day of driving, there are plenty of stops along the way to stretch your legs and to appreciate some of the history that this route, The Route of the Sun, holds. Your first stop is the archaeological site of Pukara which dates back to approximately the first century. The small museum here has items of the lithic Pukara culture. You drive over La Raya Pass where there is a stunning view across to the snow-capped mountains and over a beautiful old chapel, standing alone in the middle of the Andean plateau before a stop for lunch in the picturesque Sicuani.</p><p>Jump back on the bus and whilst your journey takes you onwards, your next stop takes you further back in time. Built in the fifteenth century, Raqchi is considered by historians to be one of the most audacious Inca constructions. The remarkable Wiracocha temple, 100 metres long and 20 metres wide is made of adobe walls, built on top of volcanic stone foundations. Your final stop is at Andahuaylillas church, also known as the Sistine Chapel of the Americas thanks to its intricately painted ceilings and other murals.</p><p>You will arrive in Cusco in the early evening and you will then be taken to your hotel by private vehicle. A UNESCO World Heritage site, Cusco was the capital of the Inca Empire and traces of its past can be found around nearly every corner. From old Incan walkways to beautiful well preserved colonial architecture, Cusco has a varied history that is evident at a glance.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

This afternoon you will join a group to explore the churches and cathedral around the charming Plaza de Armas. Your next stop will be the complex of Koricancha which contained the Temple of the Sun, the most sacred site in the Inca religion. It was the centrepiece of a vast astronomical observatory. Little remains of it today except for sections of its stone walls which hint at the sites once massive size. The Christian monastery of Santo Domingo was built on top of the complex, no doubt to signify that one religion had been replaced by another. Afterwards, you will drive to the nearby ruins of Sacsayhuaman which reveal the Incas extraordinary architecture. Like all Inca constructions, the stones fit together perfectly without mortar and it would be hard to fit a single sheet of paper even between the biggest. It took almost one hundred years and thousands of men to complete.</p><p>Next it is on to a site shrouded in mystery, the large rock and intricate complex of Qenko. The site is named for the zigzag channels carved into the rock which are believed to have been used by Inca priests to pour sacred chicha or llama blood into as part of an annual ritual. Tambomachay is thought to be have been used to worship water as the source of life. Two aqueducts, artistically carved on the rock, transport and keep a constant flow of clean water. Your final stop is the red fortress of Puka Pukara which took its name from the colour of the stones (especially at dusk).</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

Here the Incas lived, farmed and enjoyed the natural wealth of this verdant region. Visit the colourful and vibrant arts and crafts market in Pisac. The nearby Inca site has a citadel, turrets, military fortresses and astronomical observatories. The largest Inca cemetery in South America is also located here.</p><p>You will continue onto the town of Ollantaytambo, which has many houses built on the bases of the old Inca town with local people maintaining their ancestral customs. The complexity of these Inca constructions incorporated into the contemporary town is considered by many to be one of the most important living museums in the world. Above the town, the military fortress that protected this area of the valley prevails strategically between two mountains. On the summit of the archaeological complex stand six enormous monoliths with mysterious engravings of Inca iconography.</p><p>You will overnight in Ollantaytambo and the evening is free here at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
