Mexico City is a dizzying blend of culture and tradition with a huge variety of activities to suit every traveller.</p><p>Today is free to arrive at your leisure and immerse yourself in the city. Head to the Zocalo, the huge central square where you can find Aztec ruins and colonial architecture, including the beautiful main cathedral. Remember to look through the glass flooring outside of the church to see the ancient Aztec city beneath. Just behind the cathedral are the Aztec ruins of the ancient Teocali, which were only discovered in 1978. You can also visit the world famous Anthropology Museum and the National Palace where you can see murals depicting the history of Mexico by one of the country's most famous artists Diego Rivera. Check out his equally famous wife at the Frida Kahlo Museum. (advisable to book tickets in advance online).</p><p>In the evening you can enjoy a spicy Mexican dinner and maybe a few tequilas in the Zona Rosa while enjoying music performed by a mariachi band.</p><p>Please note there will be a pre departure meeting at 6pm tonight to meet your tour leader and fellow group members.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Kali Ciudadela or similar .

Here you will see an amazing abandoned city built around 300 BC by a civilisation now lost in the mists of time. The historic complex is a fascinating combination of ceremonial pyramids, such as the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon. Other landmarks include the Ciudadela, which is connected by the Street of the Dead, palaces, old temples and the Plaza of the Sun. The buildings are decorated with friezes and other ornate artworks.</p><p>We continue to one of Mexico's oldest towns, Puebla, which means "City of the Angels". Set in a valley with a dramatic backdrop of volcanoes and snow-capped peaks, Puebla is a fascinating old colonial town founded in 1531. The historic city centre has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, partly due to its impressively preserved Spanish colonial architecture. Puebla is the best place to try mole poblano, a rich, spicy sauce containing chocolate, cinnamon and nuts, as well as different types of hot peppers, often served over chicken.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel La Alhondiga or similar .

Built between the 15th and 16th centuries as part of the city’s Dominican monastery, the building has extremely thick stone walls since the region is prone to earthquakes.</p><p>Oaxaca City is also well known for having some amazing art galleries, especially smaller independent ones hidden down the cobbled streets. The food here is some of the best you will find in Mexico, be sure to try a tlayudas, a large crispy tortilla topped with beans, cheese and avocado.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Oaxaca Real or similar .

Capital of the Yucatan province, the 'white city' of Mérida is a pleasant mixture of colonial buildings, churches and plazas. The city boasts rich culture, history and traditions, with markets overflowing with beautiful weaving and handmade crafts. A walk through the city’s downtown buildings is an attraction in itself, as you witness the brightly painted houses which mirror it’s colonial past.</p><p>For art lovers, check out the Museum of Modern Art which is located next to the Cathedral. The museum regularly exhibits Yucatan artists who promote their country and local traditions. The Lucas de Galvéz market is another must see. The largest market in town, it sells plenty of local produce and is the ultimate place to try dishes typical of Yucatan. Have a sopa de lima (lime soup), or frijol con puerco (beans with pork) both which are specialities of the region.</p><p>Evening is often the best time to explore as the city comes alive with night markets or music and dancing in many of the squares.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Colonial or similar .

Constructed between the 7th and 10th century AD, Chichén Itzá was a centre of pilgrimage for the Maya for over 1000 years. The most famous attraction is the great Pyramid of Kukulkan, dedicated to the feathered serpent god Kukulkan and built with such precision that a shadow serpent descends down the steps during the equinox. After soaking up the beauty of Chichén Itzá, we will continue onto Playa del Carmen.</p><p>Playa del Carmen is the perfect place for relaxation. The beaches are coated with sugar-white sand with shimmering turquoise waters to swim in. You have the rest of the day to relax by the pool, beach, or simply explore the area.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Playa del Carmen or similar .

Cuban days consist of sunshine, music, beaches and an overall contagious atmosphere. From the colourful colonial buildings to the picture perfect 1940's cars, the streets of Havana are taken straight from a postcard.</p><p>Havana is considered the beating heart of Cuba. The UNESCO Old Town is a wonderful place to stroll around, taking in the architecture and colours that surround you.

There is a museum where you will further learn about the history, and you will then have some time to swim or snorkel in what can only be described as one of Cuba&amp;#39;s best reefs!</p><p>We then continue onto Cienfuegos, also known as the Paris of the Caribbean due to its wide boulevards and expansive parks. In 1819 the city was settled by French migrants who made it their home. French influence can be widely seen throughout the city and many of the streets reflect the French language in their name: Bouyon and D&amp;#39;Clouet for example.</p><p>Upon arrival we will enjoy an orientation walk of the city. Get your camera ready for the charm and history that will be found throughout! We will visit the Castillo de Jagua, the ancient fort that once protected Cuba from pirate attacks.

Santa Clara holds a special place in the revolutionary history of Cuba and today oozes a youthful culture and lively nightlife due to having one of Cuba&amp;#39;s largest universities.</p><p>Santa Clara is infamous for being one of the final and bloodiest battles in the revolution, and is the final resting place of Che Guevara &amp;#45; a hero of the Cuban Revolution. Guevara arrived on New Years Eve in 1958, fighting against the regime of General Batista. A mere 12 hours into the battle, Batista fled Cuba and the revolutionaries claimed victory. Guevera quickly became a key figure in the Cuban Revolution and later attempted to incite the same in Bolivia - ultimately leading to his execution. His body was returned to Santa Clara and laid to rest in what is now known as the Che Guevara Mausoleum.</p><p>We then continue to Trinidad, one of Cuba&amp;#39;s most alluring destinations. The town was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1988 and we guarantee you will find beauty around every corner, from the cobbled streets to the smiling residents. You will enjoy a guided Trinidad Township walk, learning about the history and culture of this fascinating town.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in casas particulares .

your tour in Mexico City</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Hotel Kali Ciudadela<br /> Revillagigedo 92<br /> Colonia Centro<br /> Mexico City<br /> Mexico</p>
<p>Tel: (+52) 55 5521 9594</p>
<p>Please leave all of your important documents and extra money here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you.</p>
<p>It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major Central American cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Mexico City</h5>
<p>When arriving at <a href="https://www.tucantravel.com/mexico-city-city-guide">Mexico City</a>&amp;rsquo;s international airport we recommend that you obtain some Mexican pesos as soon as you arrive. There are numerous international ATMs inside the airport, as well as money exchange offices offering a good rate. The rate will always be slightly lower at the airport than in the city centre, but it may be inconvenient to find an exchange office open in the city.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If making your own way to the hotel it is highly advisable to approach the official taxi stalls right outside of arrivals to avoid scams. It is also recommended to have the address of your hotel printed out to give to the taxi driver. The stalls will offer taxis at a fixed rate based on the destination and will accept cash and credit card, the cost to <a href="mexico-city-city-guide">Mexico City</a> Historic Centre should be about 250 - 300 pesos. Note that sometimes these certified taxi stalls may try to sell you a big van for 5+ people at a higher cost, be clear that you only want a small car.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a great variety of accommodation, providing you with unique experiences to last a lifetime! You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<p>Our Cuba tours stay in "casas particulares" which are local Cuban homestays. This is the best way to ensure the money is going back to the local communities and also provides travellers with a wonderfully authentic experience. Each casa will be different but you will always enjoy a private room for you and your partner/friend/roommate. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. If you are travelling as a couple and wish to book a double bed, please advise your Adventure Specialist at time of booking.</p>
<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on all occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses private minivans. The mode of transport is chosen based on schedule and timings, comfort, group size, location and reliability.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport. You must be able to comfortably lift your luggage off transport and into hotels.</p>
<p>To reach Caye Caulker we will catch a local ferry. If you are prone to seasickness we suggest you have tablets on hand.</p>
<h5>Flights</h5>
<p>There are a total of 2 flights included on this tour so you should pay particular attention to the weight limit of your luggage. Tucan Travel tours have a checked luggage restriction of up to 20kg in total.

Any excess luggage must be paid by the customer.</p>

<p>You will be carrying your own luggage on tour. Please limit this to one piece per person plus one day bag.</p>
<h5>Flights</h5>
<p>If your tour includes internal flights please be aware there is often a restriction of 15kg for checked baggage. If your luggage exceeds this weight you will need to pay any fees incurred.</p>
<p>It is important to bring luggage you can carry and lift comfortably, potentially up several flights of stairs in hotels where elevators are not available and between bus/train stations and hotels.</p>
<h5>Packing List</h5>
<p>Please consider which season you are travelling in and pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, Central America is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong to cover up for this.</p>
<p>What essential items should I bring to Central America and Cuba?</p>
<ul>
<li>A small daypack - This should have enough room to carry food and snacks for long hikes or day trips.</li>
<li>Good, comfortable walking shoes or trainer AND flip flops. You will need comfortable trainers for any day hikes you wish to enjoy on this trip and flip flops or other sandals are essential for the beach.</li>
<li>Insect Repellent (DEET 35% min) and bite cream.</li>
<li>Sunscreen - This should be a large bottle and enough to cover you for Cuba. Buying sunscreen in Cuba is expensive - around 25 dollars to it&amp;rsquo;s best to take some from home!</li>
<li>Portable battery charger - this can come in handy if you are unlucky enough to experience power shortages in Cuba and need to charge your camera or phone.</li>
<li>Swimwear &amp;amp; towel - While the casas in Cuba do provide towels you might want one for when you are at the beach or stopping over at areas like the Bay of Pigs!</li>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the below currencies:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Mexican Peso</li>
<li>Belize Dollar</li>
<li>Guatemalan Quetzal</li>
<li>Cuban Peso</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Central America will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<p>Some shops and restaurants in Cuba accept card but it is not common and we suggest not to rely on this. Please ensure you have access to cash for the duration of your stay.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Spending Money in Cuba</h5>
<p>It is best to bring CAD$, Euro or Sterling to Exchange for CUC's in Cuba. Please note that the Cuban government surcharges an extra 10% to exchange USD$ in Cuba. With regards to the use of Credit or Debit cards in Cuba the following applies. No card issued by a bank that has any connection with the United States will be accepted in Cuba. Debit/ Credit cards with the VISA logo can be used in ATM's or to draw money from a Cadeca or Bank. MASTERCARDS will not be accepted in ATM's but, as with VISA cards, so long as they are issued by a non US based bank, can be used to draw cash at the counter of a Cadeca or Bank.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to the rules above, so please check with your bank/ payments provider before travelling to Cuba.</p>
<p>Please review this Trip Advisor <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Travel-g147270-c69372/Cuba:Caribbean:Currency.And.Credit.Cards.html">link</a> for further details</p>
<p>For US travellers - check out this recent <a href="http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-tr-spot-20150621-story.html">article</a> for an analysis of whether to convert your U.S. cash to another currency.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of Central American culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Departing Cuba</h5>
<p>The Cuban government does not allow for CUC currency to leave the country, therefore you should aim to spend it all before leaving for the airport. If you have currency on you, authorities have the right to confiscate this at the airport AFTER check-in. There are a few shops in terminal 3 (before check in) where you may spend CUC on souvenirs if you have some left. There is also a money exchange booth in terminal 3 where you can change remaining CUC into USD, CAD, GBP or EUR, however there is never a guarantee the booth will have enough money so we recommend not to rely on this for changing large amounts. In terminal 3, AFTER check-in, there is no where that will accept CUC and you must pay in either USD, CAD or EUR. These rules also apply to terminal 2.</p>
<h5>Free Walking Tours</h5>
<p>Free walking tours are found in many of the large cities, especially in the larger cities where you will find a few companies offering the same tour. These are marketed as free walking tours and are designed to provide travellers with local, in depth knowledge of the city. However all free walking tours are tip based (they have to make money somehow, after all!) and so if you wish to join a free walking tour you need to budget in a tip at the end. Leaving a free walking tour that was considered a good tour without tipping is very disrespectful and will only give travellers a bad reputation.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of Asian cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p>
<p>Food in Central America varies between each country. Mexico is known for having some of the best food on the continent while Costa Rica is known for its fresh and tropical fruit. Vegetarians will have no problem finding delicious meals, as many of the dishes are rich in rice, beans, vegetables and eggs.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>Central America is known for having some of the best street food in the world. Eating at local markets is a great way to experience authentic food and at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in Central America</h5>
<p>Central America is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<p>Travel Insurance</p>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<p>Pack a Medical Kit</p>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<p>Vaccinations</p>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. There are no official required vaccinations for Central America however if you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<p>Horse Riding</p>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.

<p>This tour is modular and group composition might change in Havana with people joining the Cuba part of the trip.</p>
<p>This tour uses a mixture of transport - two flights, busses, private vehicles and ferries. It is essential that you can carry your own luggage.</p>
<p>This tour has a few long travel days. These are unavoidable when covering such large distances however a good book and your new friends will make the time pass quicker.</p>
