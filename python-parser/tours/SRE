Once a Portuguese and Dutch trading port, popular attractions here include the Old Dutch fort gate built in 1672, the Dutch Canal, and the old churches and fishing villages which surround the area. In fact, due to the many ornate Roman Catholic churches scattered throughout, Negombo is sometimes known as &amp;#34;The Little Rome&amp;#34;. It also has a huge and rather inviting white sandy beach!</p><p>Also worth exploring is the Kochchikade area, that comes to life at dusk with many handicrafts for sale, boutiques, shops, gem shops and restaurants for you to explore.</p><p>There will be a pre departure meeting tonight at 6pm where you will meet your tour leader and fellow travellers.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Camelot Beach Hotel or similar .

your tour in Negombo</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Camelot Beach Hotel<br />No345 Lewis Place, 11500<br />Negombo<br />Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Tel: +94 312 235 881 / +94 312 235 882</p>
<p>There are safe deposit boxes for your use in the room. Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you. There is a laundry service, a money exchange service and free wifi available in the hotel. It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Negombo</h5>
<p>When arriving at Bandaranaike International Airport we recommend that you obtain some Sri Lankan rupee as soon as you arrive. There are international ATMs inside the airports, as well as money exchange offices offering a good rate. The rate will always vary slightly depending on where you go, it may be worth changing a small amount of money at the airport for your transport, and then finding a bank or money exchange within the town centre.</p>
<p>The airport is the only international airport in Sri Lanka and also services the capital, Colombo. However it is closer to Negombo, where our hotel is, than it is to Colombo. Please make sure when transiting from the airport you travel to Negombo and not to the capital.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<p>Contact your arrival transfer:</p>

<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel, an official taxi to our hotel in Negombo will cost approximately 1,000-1,200 rupees (US$10-$11). The taxis should work on a metered system, please make sure they set the meter when you first enter. If they refuse or do not have one, you must set the price before you begin your journey. The journey will take approximately 30 minutes to reach the hotel.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport. You must be able to comfortably lift your luggage off transport and into hotels, perhaps up stairs.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the Sri Lankan rupee.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in the larger cities will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. In general, Southeast Asia is a cheap destination.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is not a big part of Sri Lankan culture however it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p>

</description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cooler depending on the season you are travelling, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus a thinner sweater which you can layer.</p>
<p>In general, Sri Lanka is a conservative country and you should keep your legs and shoulders covered when out in public.</p>

Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section.

<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1.

<p>If you require urgent assistance before meeting your tour please call (+66) 633 21 0066.</p>
<h5>Safety in Sri Lanka</h5>
<p>Sri Lanka is generally safe, even more so in a group tour. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<p>Travel Insurance</p>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<p>Pack a Medical Kit</p>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<p>Vaccinations</p>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera, Diphtheria and influenza.</p>
<p>Horse Riding</p>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip.
