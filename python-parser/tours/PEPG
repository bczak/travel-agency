This point is a headland with two protected turquoise coves on either side, making it a great place for deep-water snorkelling thanks to its location in one of the richest marine ecosystems on Earth, the Bolivar Channel. A wide variety of marine life can be seen underwater including sea horses, Frogfish and Octopi. Groups of dolphins, Sea Lions and tunas can sometimes be spotted in this area too. You will then take an hour-long dinghy ride along the sheer cliffs to observe a great diversity of sea and coastal birds including Brown pelicans and Galapagos penguins.</p><p>In the afternoon we cross the Bolivar Channel. In the cold season (from May to December), this stretch of the cruise offers spectacular whale-watching opportunities. We have a dry landing at Espinosa Point on Fernandina Island, the youngest of the Galápagos and one of the most volcanically-active islands, as eruptions occur every few years. You will see the biggest, most primitive-looking race of marine iguanas mingling with Sally Lightfoot Crabs, as well as Flightless Cormorants resting at their nesting sites. Galápagos penguins, Galápagos Hawks and Sea Lions can also be seen here.</p><p>Among the flora and volcanic formations observers will spot brachycereus cactus, "pa-hoe-hoe" lava and "AA" lava formations.

We'll also explore the uplifted coral reef that resulted from the volcanic activity of 1954, with a spectacular view of Alcedo Volcano. You will also go snorkelling around the bay, giving you the chance to swim with Sea turtles, Sea lions and countless varieties of tropical fish.</p><p>Difficulty Level: Intermediate</p><p>Type of Terrain: flat &amp; rocky</p><p>In the afternoon, we have our final stop on Isabela, Tagus Cove (dry landing) where we will learn about the eruption of five volcanoes that formed this island, the largest of the Galapagos archipelago. We will walk along a trail that leads to the Darwin salt-water Crater Lake, passing spectacular lava fields and volcanic formations. We will take a dinghy to observe marine life - Galápagos penguins can frequently be seen here. Tagus Cove, named for the British naval vessel that moored here in 1814, was used historically as an anchorage for pirates and whalers. Graffiti carved into the rocks near the landing point believed to have been made by 19th century pirates helps passengers better appreciate the relationship between the islands and tourism today. We will also have an opportunity to snorkel in deep water.</p><p>Difficulty Level: Intermediate/Difficult</p><p>Type of Terrain: Steep</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on boat  at Coral Expedition Cruise or similar .

From here we visit the Salt Mines before walking along the Egas Port trail that takes us around the shoreline and to the best tidal pool areas in the Galapagos, populated by Fur Seals and Sally Lightfoot crabs. The unique terrain of Santiago's shores is home to a variety of resident and migrant birds. There is another opportunity to go snorkelling or swimming, and you may see lobsters, starfish, marine iguanas grazing on algae beds under the sea.</p><p>Difficulty Level: Intermediate</p><p>Type of Terrain: flat &amp; rocky</p><p>In the afternoon we have a wet landing at Sullivan Bay, on the other side of Santiago Island.

The islands are teeming with over 150 species of bird life (including penguins, cormorants, boobies and pelicans) and are home to thousands of sea lions and boast some amazing rock formations. Although it is not possible to set foot on the islands, you will experience the magnificent sights and sounds of the vast array of wildlife and maybe even spot seals and dolphins playing around the boat. Our boat trip also takes us past the mysterious Candelabra figure etched on the side of a mountain. Best viewed from the sea, many believe the Candelabra is linked to the Nazca Lines.</p><p>This afternoon we leave Paracas behind and journey towards Nazca in a private vehicle. On the way, the group will stop at the Huacachina Oasis, deep in the Huacachina Desert. Here you have the chance to get your adrenaline pumping with the optional excursions available. Try sand-boarding down the vast dunes or cruise over them in a dune-buggy. After you have explored the desert, continue driving to Nazca.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Alegria or similar .

These strange parallel lines and geometrical figures are etched into the desert floor. Although there is a viewing tower, these strange designs can only be fully appreciated from the air. You can take a fascinating flight over the lines and shapes, which include a monkey, hummingbird, condor, spider and even a spaceman. The designs are thought to have been made by three different groups of people: the Paracas (900 -200 BC), the Nazca (200BC -600AD) and then new migrants from Ayacucho around 630AD. You can also take optional tours to visit the underground aqueducts, gold mines and ceramic shops.</p><p>Pack up on snacks as we will take taxis to the bus station and embark on an overnight bus journey to Arequipa.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on overnight sleeper buses .

There are some fantastic restaurants in Arequipa and it is possible to enjoy many Peruvian delicacies here. Besides the stimulating architecture, one of the the main attractions is the Santa Catalina Convent, which is almost a city in itself with its maze of cobbled streets, cloisters and decorative buildings. Don't miss the nuns' café for excellent freshly baked treats! Another popular attraction is the acclaimed Museo Santuarios Andinos which houses many well preserved mummies. The most famous of the mummies is Juanita, a young Inca maiden who was sacrificed around the year AD 1450 atop the Nevado Ampato volcano to appease the gods and ask for a good harvest. Juanita was sacrificed then frozen by snowfall at the top of the mountain, hence her nickname ‘ice princess’. She was rediscovered in the 1990s when ash from the volcano melted the snow around her.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Casona Plaza Hotel Colonial or similar .

Pass breathtaking Andean mountain scenery on this full day journey. Cusco, which means ‘navel of the earth' in the Inca language of Quechua, has a mostly indigenous population of around 300,000 and is centred around the Plaza de Armas, which is dominated by the Cathedral and La Compañia de Jesus Church. Its cloistered arcades house many fine restaurants, bars and shops which you have time to enjoy this evening.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anden Inca or similar .

At an altitude of 3800m we take slow walks that take up to an hour, around each of the ruins in order to manage any effects the high altitude may have. Firstly we visit the Pisac ruins, perched on a hilltop with incredible views of the surrounding mountains. We then go down to the famous traditional market of the same name, which is full of colour and atmosphere. A great place for souvenirs! After lunch, we continue along the valley to the temple/fortress of Ollantaytambo with its enormous Inca terracing constructed on the side of a steep mountain.</p><p>Tonight you will stay in the town of Ollantaytambo.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Tika Wasi or similar .

The first day is a relatively easy 4½ hour and 13 kilometre walk. With mostly flat and light climbs, you start to witness the lush scenery of Peru. Walking slowly, you will have plenty of short breaks to ensure the group are acclimatising to the altitude.</p><p>The Inca Trail Trek can be demanding but can be completed by anyone who leads a reasonably active life - you certainly don’t need to be an athlete. Everyone is able to walk at their own pace and there is no rush to finish. The trekking group is led by an expert local guide and supported by a team of porters and cooks, leaving you with only a small day pack to carry. If you are in any doubt or if you have any condition that may affect your ability to trek, we advise that you consult your doctor.</p><p>Please Note: Due to a limited number of people being allowed on the trail a day, permits are limited and can sell out far in advance. If you wish to book the Inca Trail, please provide your Reservations Agent with your passport details by email as soon as possible so that we can secure your permit. Without your passport details, we are unable to arrange your Inca Trail Trek. Alternatively you can opt to participate in the challenging but rewarding 1 day Inca trek. Please speak to one of our travel consultants for more information or you can read more about it here. If you are not participating in either trek then you will visit Machu Picchu by train and then have plenty of free time to enjoy the activities available in and around Cusco. Meals are included for those doing the Inca Trail Trek. If you are choosing not to do the Inca Trail Trek, you will have 2-3 days to spend exploring Cusco.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in campsites on the Inca Trek .

Sitting at 4,200 metres, it is nearly 1,800 metres higher than Machu Picchu itself. The terrain here is slightly more rockier and due to open area, trekkers are more exposed to the elements, whether it’s the rain lashing down or the sun blazing down! However it can be said that traversing this part of the trail is the second most rewarding part, just after seeing Machu Picchu itself.</p><p>You will cover approximately nine kilometres in about 5-7 hours and after the high pass it's all downhill as the trail winds its way along old Inca stairs to our campsite.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in campsites on the Inca Trek .

While being the longest day, it is also the most interesting as you pass more ruins and unique sites. After roughly one hour of trekking you will come to the ruins of Runkurakay, a small circular shaped archaeological site. It has been said this site was most likely used as resting point for the Inca messengers, who maintained communication across the Inca Empire.</p><p>From this point, it is mostly downhill, and we have four more ruin sites to be discovered, with the next being Sayacmarca. Also known to historians as the “inaccessible town” due to it being barricaded on three sides with steep mountain drop offs, archaeologists remain baffled as to what the site was used for. Some say it was a viewing and control point for those headed to Machu Picchu.</p><p>We continue onto Phuyupatamarca where you can enjoy some amazing views from the top. The Quechua translation being “town in the clouds” it offers some great photo opportunities and is often used as a lunch spot for groups.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in campsites on the Inca Trek .

There will then be time to explore on your own or simply take in the magnificence of the place after your guided tour.</p><p>The Lost City of Machu Picchu was originally completely self-contained, surrounded by agricultural terraces sufficient to feed the population, and watered by natural springs. Located high above the fast flowing Urubamba River, the cloud shrouded ruins have palaces, baths, temples, storage rooms and some 150 houses, all in a remarkable state of preservation that will simply take your breath away.</p><p>The ruins were only discovered by the outside world in 1911, when American explorer Hiram Bingham found them while looking for another “lost city” called Vilcabamba. Due to their isolation many of the buildings are still quite intact and you can't help but admire Huayna Picchu (“Young Mountain”), which towers above the ruins.</p><p>After spending most of the day at Machu Picchu you have the chance to meander through the markets of Aguas Calientes before enjoying a scenic train ride back to the Sacred Valley where our transfer to Cusco will be waiting.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Anden Inca or similar .

You can also catch a glimpse of Cristo Blanco, the large statue of Christ that towers above the city.</p><p>Spend the evening back at Plaza de Armas and experience Cusco after dark.

Covering nearly two thirds of the country, the area is home to around 600 species of birds, 1200 types of butterflies and 300 reptiles, to name a few. As eco-tourism continues to grow, there are a number of eco lodges allowing you to experience the rainforest in the most responsible and authentic way possible.</p><p>Our local representative will transfer you to the airport for your flight to the jungle community of Puerto Maldonado, the starting point for our visit to the Amazon rainforest. Here you can pick up last minute drinks and snacks before the group continue with a short bus ride followed by riverboat journey to reach the accommodation for the night. Sailing along the river, the trip takes around 2 hours and is an excellent chance to relax and start to take in the magic of the rainforest.</p><p>Arriving at your riverside lodge, check in and have some time to relax before an afternoon of exploring. After lunch we will set off on a trek through the rainforest along wooden walkways. On the way our guide will stop to show you various species of bird and explain the medicinal plants and delicate ecological systems of the Amazon Jungle. The scenery is extremely varied incorporating dense jungle as well as marsh areas. You will see incredibly big trees, several metres in diameter and around 450 years old. We walk to Cochita Caiman (Caiman Pond) where we see wildlife along the way. We then return to the lodge for dinner.</p><p>Please note: The eco-lodges in the Amazon jungle are designed to give travellers the most authentic jungle experience while limiting disruption to the animals and plantlife. The bungalows are built from local indigenous materials with the rooms sealed by mesh netting to keep mosquitoes out. All rooms have private bathroom facilities however these are basic and hot water can be limited. There is portable water available at the lodge therefore we recommend taking a reusable water bottle with you. Electricity is limited and it is advisable to bring portable chargers for your electronics and ensure they are fully charged. After dark, the walkways are lit by oil lamps. The lodges include a welcome area, dining room and bar, meaning there are plenty areas for your group to relax and socialise. Single supplements are not available in the bungalows. If you have further questions on what to expect, your tour leader will be happy to assist. All excursions in the jungle are led by an English speaking guide.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a jungle lodge at Eco Amazonia Lodge or similar .

We will return to the lodge for a well deserved lunch.</p><p>After a break and some yummy food, we take a short boat trip across the Madre de Dios River to Monkey Island. On the way over you may spot caiman from the boat. Once on the island it is possible to see a great variety of monkeys such as the ‘maquisapa’, black and white ‘Martins’, ‘Leoncito de la Selva’ (Little Lions), ‘Frailes’ (Friars), ‘Achuñis’, ‘Ronsocos’ as well as an array of birdlife. In the evenings it is often possible to enjoy the wonderful sunset, one of the most impressive sights of the forest (weather permitting).</p><p>Enjoy your final night in the heart of the jungle soaking up this magical and peaceful atmosphere.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in a jungle lodge at Eco Amazonia Lodge or similar .

Lima has many fine colonial buildings and some of the best museums in South America including the Gold Museum, Museum of the Inquisition and the Catacombs below the San Francisco Church. Peru's capital has much to offer and many of the sights, including the city's two main squares the Plaza de Armas and Plaza San Martin, boast some fantastic sightseeing opportunities. The Plaza de Armas houses the Cathedral, Municipal Palace and Presidential Palace where the changing of the guard can be seen every day at 12 noon. There are also many markets in Lima, possibly the best being in the central district.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Arawi Miraflores Express Hotel or similar .

your tour in Quito</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Cayman Hotel<br /> Juan Rodriguez 270 y Reina Victoria<br /> Quito,<br /> Ecuador</p>
<p>Tel: (+593) 2&amp;nbsp;2567 616</p>
<p>Email: hcayman@uio.satnet.net</p>
<p>The hotel serves a continental breakfast consisting of bread, jam and tea/coffee or juice, or an American breakfast with eggs. Please check with reception for serving times and prices (breakfast is not included).</p>
<p>The hotel has safe deposit boxes for your use (you will get an itemised receipt). Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you. It is Ecuadorian law that you carry a copy of your passport with you at all times. It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major South American cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Quito</h5>
<p>Quito is located at 2,800 metres above sea level, making it the second highest capital city in the world.&amp;nbsp; You may feel the effects of altitude, which&amp;nbsp;affects all people differently.&amp;nbsp;If you have just arrived&amp;nbsp;it is&amp;nbsp;suggested you take it&amp;nbsp;very easy for the first day and follow the below recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drink plenty of water, around two to two-and-a-half litres per day. Bottled water is available everywhere.</li>
<li>The affects of alcohol and cigarettes are made considerably worse by the thin air. Try to avoid these in excess for the first few days.</li>
<li>Take it easy. Walk slowly and avoid sudden movements</li>
</ul>
<p>On arrival in Quito we recommend you change enough money into the local currency for the first four or five days of your tour. The currency used in Ecuador is the US dollar. These are available from ATMs or with US$ travellers cheques. Ecuadorian notes tend to be of poor quality and you will have trouble exchanging these if you are travelling outside of Ecuador.</p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel,&amp;nbsp;you will find a 24-hour taxi rank outside the airport. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have any problem getting a taxi as they are all metered (yellow taxis) and tend to wait in an orderly line outside the terminal. Unlicensed taxis are also available but you will have to haggle for a good price which can be difficult if you do not speak Spanish. In 2013, Ecuador opened it's new international airport in Quito. The airport is approximately 90 minutes from the city centre (depending on traffic) and the cost of a taxi to our hotel in Quito should be approximately $25-35. Given the airport's location out of town, please allow plenty of time to arrive at the airport before your departure.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a great variety of accommodation, providing you with unique experiences to last a lifetime! You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>

<p><strong>Inca Trail Trek</strong> - You will be camping in comfy tents (2 people max per tent) on your way to Machu Picchu. The tents are equipped with sleeping mats but you will need to bring a sleeping bag or rent one from the Tour Leader for US$15. Each campsite has toilet blocks, but you should ensure you pack toilet roll as this is rarely available. For more information on what to pack please <a href="the-inca-trail">click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Jungle lodge</strong> - The bungalows used in the Amazon Jungle are eco-friendly and made from local materials. Each room is equipped with meshing to keep them bug free and they all have basic private bathrooms. There is potable water available at the lodge, so you just need to bring a refillable bottle to the Amazon Jungle. Please note, hot water may be limited. Electricity is also limited so phones and cameras should be charged as much as possible before arrival.</p>
<p><strong>Galapagos Cruise</strong> - Unless you have upgraded to your own room you will be sharing a twin room (single travellers only). Passengers travelling together will share a twin or double room. The cabins are small but comfortable and offer porthole windows, A/C, a private bathroom and a safe deposit box.The boat has a lounge, open deck and jacuzzi, restaurant, bar, library, BBQ area and terrace.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and a cruise for the Galapagos Islands.

</ul></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><p>This extensive adventure will cover various countries and climates, therefore it's important to pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold in some locations, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<h5>Flights</h5>
<p>If your tour includes internal flights please be aware there is often a restriction of 15kg for checked baggage. If your luggage exceeds this weight you will need to pay any fees incurred.</p>
<p>In general, South America is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis.</p>
<h5>What essential items should I bring to South America?</h5>
<ul>
<li>A small daypack - This should have enough room to carry food and snacks for long hikes or day trips.</li>

<li>Insect Repellent (DEET 35% min) and bite cream.</li>
<li>Portable Electronics Charger - There will be limited to no charging facilities on the Inca Trail, Amazon Jungle, Uyuni Salt Flats and Laguna Colorada. If you wish to keep your phone and camera charged you will want to ensure you bring a portable charger that holds a few charges.</li>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses the Peruvian sol and US dollar.</p>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Galapagos Permit Fee</h5>
<p>The 100 USD permit fee for entering the Galapagos Islands is included in your tour cost.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Galapagos Cruise</h5>
<p>Upon arrival, an account will be opened for you. This will cover any extras that you purchase on board such as drinks. Reception will take copies of your passport and credit card and you will be asked to sign a voucher. All major credit cards are accepted on the boat - Diners, Visa, MasterCard, America Express. Euros and U.S Dollars are also accepted.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is a part of life in South American culture and it is becoming more common in tourist areas. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Tipping on the Inca Trail</h5>
<p>This tour includes the tip for your porters, guides and chef for the full four day Inca Trail Trek.</p>
<h5>Tipping on the Galapagos Cruise</h5>
<p>Tipping your local guides and staff on the Galapagos Cruise is very much expected, however the amount is at your discretion.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in South America</h5>
<p>South America is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Altitude Sickness</h5>
<p>All clients warrant and accept that there is a chance they may get some form of altitude sickness on itineraries that generally travel to altitudes over 2,400 metres though Tucan Travel will not expose clients to any undue risk of altitude sickness. Tucan Travel tour leaders, staff and local suppliers working at higher altitudes will have some level of knowledge and / or training on how to help and advise you. Please read the information contained <a href="high-altitude-sickness">here</a> to ensure you understand the risks and what to do in this event.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours.
