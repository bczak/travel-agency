You are free today to arrive at your leisure and start enjoying the sights. We recommend booking pre tour accommodation to enjoy all the city has to offer.</p><p>The capital and economic centre of Chile, Santiago is a fast growing city encircled by the peaks of the Andes Mountains to the east and a smaller range of coastal mountains known as the Cordillera to the west. With its fountains, parks and imposing neoclassical buildings standing side-by-side with glossy office skyscrapers, Santiago is a modern city very much in touch with its colonial past. Don't forget to explore the famous historic centre along the main Plaza de Armas and come across an array of historical and public buildings. Notable sites to visit include the presidential palace, the Chilean museum of Pre-Columbian Art and the Metropolitan Cathedral.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Libertador or similar .

Under the shadow of the Andes, this picturesque place is most known for it’s incredible wine valleys.</p><p>Mendoza is where General José de San Martín organised the army with which he liberated Chile and Peru from Spanish rule in 1818. Unfortunately, few historic buildings remain after an earthquake devastated the city in 1861. However, the city was rebuilt on a grid system, resulting in the broad tree-lined streets and beautiful green plazas for which the city is famous. There are great views from the top of “Cerro de la Gloria” at Parque San Martíno.</p><p> Please Note: For the departure that arrives in Rio in time for Rio Carnival 2020, your itinerary will operate slightly differently spending an extra night in Mendoza. Please speak to an Adventure Specialist for more details.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Urbana Suites or similar .

Since the wine boom in the early 20th century, Mendoza has held its title of the largest wine growing area in Latin America, and one of the best in the world. Sitting at the foot of the Andes, the vineyards are planted at some of the highest altitudes and since the region doesn’t experience extreme temperatures, a variety of grapes are able to flourish here.</p><p>Today your group will enjoy an excursion to a local vineyard as well as a charming olive farm. Sample some of the finest wine in the region (including the world renowned Malbec!) while learning more about the history and production of wine. Enjoy a traditional Argentinian lunch at the vineyard sampling some fine local and homegrown foods. Finally, we taste various olive oils at the farm and enjoy some of the most stunning scenery the countryside has to offer.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Urbana Suites or similar .

Explore the quirky neighbourhoods and artistic markets of the city, where European and Latin American influences have mixed together to create a city like no other. To make sure you see as many of the city's historic sites as possible in the time available, we suggest taking a sight-seeing bus, which you can hop on and off as you wish. You'll see Avenida 9 de Julio (the widest avenue in the world), the impressive Teatro Colón, one of the world's best opera houses, and the famous Casa Rosada, Argentina’s presidential palace, from where Juan and Eva Perón famously addressed the crowds gathered on Plaza de Mayo in 1945.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel TWO or similar .

Wander around the variety of craft markets, where you may come across live bands, barbecues, make-shift bars and practising tango dancers for a truly atmospheric Latin-American experience. San Telmo is the best market for antiques, while the market at Recoleta has great hand-made crafts. No visit to Buenos Aires would be complete without a stroll around the upmarket boutiques and cafés of the Palermo district, and the contrasting bohemian barrio of La Boca, where inhabitants of the area used left-over paint from the nearby shipyards to paint their humble houses made of scrap metal in bright, block colours.</p><p>The city is also world-renowned for its incredible nightlife, with many nightclubs, bars, restaurants and cinemas open all night. For a great evening, you could see an authentic tango show in the city where the dance originated, and you can’t leave Buenos Aires without trying some of the best steaks in the world!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel TWO or similar .

Unlike most other waterfalls that have just one or two cataracts, at Iguazú Falls there are 275 cataracts in a magnificent 3 kilometre long U shape that we will visit from both sides. Visiting the Argentine side of the falls you can board a speed boat which will take you under the falls soaking you from head to toe, an optional adventure you'll never forget! On the Argentine side you'll also find the famous "Devil's Throat" where fourteen falls drop with such force that there is always a massive cloud of spray overhead. Following this we transfer to Brazil by land.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Taroba Express or similar .

On the Brazilian side you can see the falls by walking through the rainforest and along catwalks above and below the rushing water. You can also visit the world's largest hydroelectric dam at Itaipu (optional) where you can learn more about the ecological issues faced during the dam's construction. There is also a very interesting bird park nearby, perfect for that must-have photo with a toucan!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Taroba Express or similar .

A highlight for many would be to experience the majestic gaze of Christ the Redeemer at the top of Corcovado, the breath-taking panoramic views from the top of Sugarloaf Mountain, and the vibrant coloured tiles of the Selarón staircase. You can walk from the top of the staircase up to the quiet hill-top neighbourhood of Santa Teresa, with many quaint cafés and shops lining the cobblestone streets. In the city centre, you can stroll around Rio's old colonial buildings and wander around the skyscrapers of the financial district.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Regina or similar .

your tour in Santiago </name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Hotel Libertador&amp;nbsp;<br /> Avenida Libertador Bernado O&amp;rsquo; Higgins 853<br /> Santiago,<br /> Chile</p>
<p>Tel: (+56) 2 639 4211<br /> Fax: (+56) 2 632 7128</p>
<p>The hotel serves a continental breakfast consisting of bread, jam and tea/coffee or juice, or an American breakfast with eggs. Please check with reception for serving times and prices (breakfast is not included).</p>
<p>The hotel has safe deposit boxes for your use (you will get an itemised receipt). Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you.</p>
<p>It is advisable not to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major South American cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Santiago</h5>
<p>On arrival in Santiago, we recommend you change enough money into the local currency (the Chilean peso) for the first four or five days of your trip. This is especially important if you are arriving on a Saturday night. The exchange rate at the airport is just as good as in the city centre. As you come out of immigration you will find the bank right in front of you before you turn left into the baggage claim area or you can use one of the ATMs outside the terminal.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 18px;">Upon arrival to Santiago by air, Australian and Mexican citizens are required to pay a reciprocity fee. The fees are as follows: Australian nationals: US$117 and Mexicans: US$27. These amounts may change according to the reciprocal visa fee amounts set by other countries.</span></p>
<h5>Airport Transfers</h5>
<p>Airport transfers are not included in the tour price and must be booked separately in advance through Tucan Travel. If you have booked an airport/hotel transfer with us, please look out for someone with a sign which has your name, Tucan Travel, or both after exiting the customs hall.</p>
<p>Scam taxis are common in this airport, if they do not have your name on a board they are not associated with Tucan Travel. If for any reason you do need to take a taxi, do not pay more than 40,000 Chilean pesos.</p>
<p>If you have booked an arrival transfer with us and you are going to be delayed by more than two hours, you must advise us of the delay at least six hours before arrival. If we are advised in time, we will make every effort to reschedule your transfer and your driver will be asked to wait for two hours after your new expected arrival time. However, if we are not made aware of any change, the driver will only wait for two hours after the original scheduled arrival time and after this point it will be up to you to arrange transport to your hotel at your own expense. Please contact us on the emergency contact details below if you are likely to be delayed.</p>
<p>Contact your arrival transfer:</p>
<p>Contact: LUIS VARGAS<br /> <strong>Phone: </strong>+56 9 97793230 of +56 9 42715657</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>If you would prefer to make your own way to and from your hotel,&amp;nbsp;you can either take a taxi from the rank outside or you can arrange to pay for a taxi at one of the pre-pay taxi desks just before you get to the luggage hall. You then hand a ticket to the driver rather than paying in the taxi. Licensed and unlicensed taxis are also available outside but you will have to haggle for a good price which can be difficult if you do not speak Spanish. If you do use these taxis you should agree a price before setting off and get the driver to write down the price (be clear on whether they are talking about pesos or US dollars). The airport is approximately 30 minutes from the city centre (depending on traffic) and the cost of a taxi to our hotel in Santiago should be approximately US$18.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a great variety of accommodation, providing you with unique experiences to last a lifetime! You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites. From time to time, accommodation standard may vary and hot water, wi-fi or electricity may not be to a Western standard.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room.</p>
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans. The mode of transport is chosen based on schedule and timings, comfort, group size, location and reliability.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport.</p>

Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold in some locations, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<h5>Flights</h5>
<p>If your tour includes internal flights please be aware there is often a restriction of 15kg for checked baggage. If your luggage exceeds this weight you will need to pay any fees incurred.</p>

<p>Laundry</p>
<p>Depending on the time spent in each destination, your Tour Leader will be able to advise on laundromats or laundry services in or near our hotels. Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses three different currencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chilean Peso</li>
<li>Argentinian Peso</li>
<li>Brazilian Real</li>
</ul>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Most lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is part of life in South America. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Free Walking Tours</h5>
<p>Free walking tours are found in many of the large cities. These are marketed as free walking tours and are designed to provide travellers with local, in depth knowledge of the city. However all free walking tours are tip based (they have to make money somehow, after all!) and so if you wish to join a free walking tour you need to budget in a tip at the end. Leaving a free walking tour that was considered a good tour without tipping is very disrespectful and will only give travellers a bad reputation.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about this tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of Asian cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Breakfast varies from extensive buffets to simple local spreads. For early departures, you may be provided with a breakfast box. Breakfasts on this tour vary greatly. Depending on the location, you can find anything from a well put together western buffet to a continental breakfast or a smaller offering of local food.</p>
<p>Overall the food scene in South America is incredible and you will get to experience everything from local lunches in rural areas to high end restaurants in the bigger cities. The markets in Cusco and the Central Market in Santiago are especially good to pick up some local treats. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join.</p>
<h5>Local Markets and Street Food</h5>
<p>South America has some amazing markets selling delicious food. Eating at local markets is a great way to experience authentic food and at a fraction of the cost of restaurants. Your tour leader will be able to offer advice on markets and street food in each destination.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Number</h5>
<p>If you require urgent assistance prior to joining your tour please call (+51) 984-762-164 or (+51) 970-038-181.</p>
<h5>Safety in South America</h5>
<p>South America is a vast continent and crime does exist in many areas. However, it is generally not as bad as the reputation it is perceived to have and most travellers enjoy trouble free visits. Here are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
<li>Do not take photos of military, police or border control.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The safety of our travellers is a number one priority when operating our tours. As a British registered company the lead is taken from the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO). Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the FCO.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Pack a Medical Kit</h5>
<p>A medical kit is handy for minor wounds and ailments. In areas with limited or dubious medical facilities, an emergency medical kit containing sterile syringes is also advisable. By law our staff are not allowed to administer first aid or give drugs to travellers, so please be prepared with your own supplies. If you are taking medication, please ensure you bring an adequate supply and a letter from your doctor to avoid potential issues at border crossings.</p>
<h5>Altitude Sickness</h5>
<p>All clients warrant and accept that there is a chance they may get some form of altitude sickness on itineraries that generally travel to altitudes over 2,400 metres though Tucan Travel will not expose clients to any undue risk of altitude sickness. Tucan Travel tour leaders, staff and local suppliers working at higher altitudes will have some level of knowledge and / or training on how to help and advise you. Please read the information contained <a href="high-altitude-sickness">here</a> to ensure you understand the risks and what to do in this event.</p>
<h5>Vaccinations</h5>
<p>It is important to consult your doctor or travel clinic in good time before your tour departs to determine what vaccinations you require. If you are coming from a yellow-fever infected country then you must have had a yellow-fever vaccine and carry the certificate with you. It is also recommended to be up to date with typhoid, hepatitis A and B, TDap, Cholera and Diphtheria. Malaria risks vary according to location and season, so it is a good idea to seek the advice of your GP before travelling.</p>
<h5>Horse Riding</h5>
<p>All clients wishing to participate in horse riding or similar activities, whether included or optional, acknowledge that the availability of protective headgear can vary or be non-existent. Therefore Tucan Travel cannot guarantee that headgear will be provided or will be to the same standard as those available in the UK or your home country. Any client intending to partake in these activities should bring their own protective headgear and other protective equipment with them.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours. If you are travelling with children please contact our tailor-made team for a bespoke holiday.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
