Many villagers live a traditional life as little changed since pre-Columbian times and they still wear richly-woven costumes, the colours and designs varying from place to place. The scenery is breath-taking - volcanic landscapes, beautiful lakes surrounded by forest-cloaked volcanoes and tropical rainforest, much of which hides vast complexes from ancient civilisations. The Spanish also left their mark, most notably in Antigua with its shady plazas and colonial houses and courtyards.</p><p>On arrival at Guatemala City Airport you will be transferred to Antigua</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .

You will visit the Arco de San Catalina which was built to keep nuns from sight when their convent expanded to the building across the street. You will see the San Francisco Church, built in 1542. It is the oldest functioning church in the city. On a sunny day, the vibrant yellow paint and intricate white carvings of La Merced Church are stunning. The attached monastery houses a huge fountain in the shape of a water lily, a symbol from the Maya indicating that the ancient religions were incorporated into Catholicism.</p><p>When you have had your fill of history, you will head out to the local market on the fringes of the old town. You can find almost anything you may need here and a few things you may never have thought of as well. You will also visit the Chocolate Museum where you will be able to see the process of taking the cacao bean to the chocolate bar. Finally, you will travel to the La Azote Coffee Farm and the Mayan Musical instruments Museum. The evening is at your leisure.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels .
