Ushuaia, with a population of about 42,000, is in Argentine Tierra del Fuego. The world&amp;#39;s most southerly town, Ushuaia is surrounded by snow-covered peaks, a beautiful bay and the Beagle Channel &amp;#45; named after Charles Darwin&amp;#39;s 1830&amp;#39;s exploration ship. Ushuaia&amp;#39;s history is still visible in many of its old buildings and there are several excellent museums.</p><p>We board our ship, the M/V Ushuaia around 4pm at the Tierra del Fuego Port of Ushuaia and set sail at around 7pm through the Beagle Channel, the Mackinley Pass and pass the Logos shipwreck. After boarding you will have an introduction to the ship and its amenities and have the chance to ask any questions.</p><p>We strongly recommend arriving to Ushuaia one or two days before your departure date in case of flight delays or lost luggage. The ship departs promptly and will not wait for delayed passengers.</p><p>Please read your trip notes for in depth information on what to expect onboard.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on boat  .

It marks the Antarctic Convergence, a biological barrier where cold polar water sinks beneath the warmer northern waters. This creates a great upwelling of nutrients, which sustains the biodiversity of this region and also marks the northern limit of many Antarctic seabirds.</p><p>Lecturers will be out on deck with you to help in the identification of an amazing variety of seabirds as we sail across the passage, including many albatrosses which follow in our wake.</p><p>The Drake passage can be smooth sailing one day and some of the choppiest waters in the world the next. Turbulent crossings are a &amp;#39;rite of passage&amp;#39; for most, giving a taste of adventure on the high seas that is replaced by the peacefulness and tranquillity of the Antarctic.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on boat  .

During the voyage a full program of lectures and films relative to the expedition are offered in English and Spanish.</p><p>The first sightings of icebergs and snow-capped mountains indicate that we have reached the South Shetland Islands, a group of twenty islands and islets first sighted in February 1819 by Captain William Smith of the brig Williams.</p><p>With favourable conditions in the Drake Passage our lecturers and naturalists will accompany you ashore as you experience your first encounter with the penguins and seals and will also be on hand to answer your questions and provide knowledge throughout the day.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on boat  .

You will have plenty of time to explore its amazing scenery, a pristine wilderness of snow, ice, mountains and waterways, and an incredible wide variety of wildlife. Apart from penguins and seabirds you are very likely to see Weddell, crabeater and leopard seals as well as Minke, killer (orca) and humpback whales at close range.</p><p>We hope to navigate some of the most beautiful waterways (depending on the ice conditions): the Gerlache Strait, the Neumayer Channel, and the Lemaire Channel, the latter are narrow passages between towering rock faces and spectacular glaciers.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on boat  .

The Nordensk&amp;#246;jld expedition built a stone survival hut here in 1903. Today its ruins have been taken over by nesting penguins. Further exploration may take you to Melchior Island, Cuverville Island, Portal Point, Neko Harbour, Pl&amp;#233;neau Island and if ice conditions permit, to Petermann Island for a visit to the southernmost colony of Gentoo Penguins.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) on boat  .
