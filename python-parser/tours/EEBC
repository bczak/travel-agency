You are free to arrive at your leisure. We highly recommend booking pre tour accommodation or arriving on an early flight so that you can fully explore this beautiful city.</p><p>Famous for its enchanting historic centre, the city is a popular holiday destination on the Gulf of Finland. Roam the cobbled streets and explore scenic ruins or climb the hill of Toompea, which is filled with medieval buildings, 14th century churches, turrets, spires and enticing alleyways.</p><p>Estonia has a long and fascinating history, having been inhabited since at least 9000 B.C. It has been ruled by Germans, Danes, Swedes, Poles and Russians, with the more distinctive Estonian identity coming to light in the late 19th century. During World War II, Estonia was ultimately incorporated into the Soviet Union after years of contest, which lead to years of communist rule. On August 20th, 1991, Estonia gained its independence.</p><p>Modern day Estonia is progressive and traditional all in one. In 2005, they became the first country to hold elections over the internet, and in 2014 the first country to make e-residency possible. The city of Tallinn has been listed as one of the most digitally advanced in the world, with the likes of Skype emerging from the small city. Nevertheless, the old quarter of Tallinn is one of the most charming and other wordly corners of Europe!</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Economy Hotel or similar .

The capital of Lithuania, Vilnius boasts an attractive baroque Old Town ,which is the largest in Eastern Europe and is praised as the 'New Prague'. Located on the edge of the Neris River, with its pine covered hills, friendly people, and blend of old and new, this is a picturesque city well worth exploring. You will have time to explore the main sights of the city including Gediminas Castle on the top of Gediminas Hill and Cathedral Square at the base of the hill, which is dominated by Vilnius Cathedral and its 57 metre-tall belfry.</p><p>While you're exploring the square between the cathedral and the tower you should hunt for the secret stebuklas (miracle) tile. The tile marks the southern end of the 2 million person, 650 kilometre long human chain between Tallinn and Vilnius, which was formed in protest against Soviet occupation in 1989. Local legend has it that if you find the pretty mosaic-covered tile you should stand on it and turn around three times clockwise while making a wish, which shall then be granted.</p></description><accommodation>1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Panorama or similar .

your tour</name><description><h5>Modular Sections</h5>
<p>This tour is a smaller section of a much larger trip. You will be with the same group and have the same tour leader for the duration of this tour.</p>
<h5>Travelling on a group tour/solo travellers</h5>
<p>Travelling on a group tour is a fantastic way to see the world whilst meeting people from different walks of life. Many people who meet on group tours become friends for life! Due to the nature of group travel, there are a few things to consider when planning your trip. Patience can sometimes be required to accommodate different needs of the group and we always ask you to stick to travel and meeting times, so the rest of the group do not suffer.</p>
<p>Our Tour Leaders sometimes like to encourage group meals - however, if you prefer being more independent you are also free to do your own thing.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about who is in your group on a particular departure, our Adventure Specialists will be able to advise on ages and demographics.</p>
<h5>Solo Travellers</h5>
<p>Over 60% of our passengers are solo travellers and all of our group tours are priced per person on a shared room basis (unless otherwise stated) meaning there is no compulsory extra payment for those travelling on their own.</p>
<p>You will be roomed with someone of the same gender who is also travelling solo.</p>
<h5>Tour Leader/Driver - what to expect</h5>
<p>This tour includes a Tucan Travel tour leader as well as local guides on some excursions.</p>
<p>The Tucan Travel tour leader will accompany you throughout the tour, leading the group from A to B and providing information and knowledge on the places visited. Your tour leader will speak English and is there to ensure the smooth running of the tour. Your tour leader will bond the group, arrange group meals, assist with daily issues and take care of all the logistics - meaning all you have to worry about is enjoying your trip of a lifetime!</p>
<p>Our tours are not hand-held tours - once settled into a location you will be given the flexibility to explore on your own, with the aid of the group leader advising on what to see and do in the area.</p></description></item><item><name>Joining your tour in Tallinn</name><description><p>Your joining location is:</p>
<p>Economy Hotel&amp;nbsp;<br />Kopli 2<br /> 10412 Tallinn,<br /> Estonia</p>
<p>There are safe deposit boxes for your use (you will get an itemised receipt). Please leave all of your important documents, money and travellers cheques here when you go out but remember to carry some form of ID and a photocopy of your passport with you.</p>
<p>It is not advisable to wear chains or expensive looking watches or jewellery while in major cities. You should also keep your camera concealed when not in use and carry daypacks on your front for extra safety.</p>
<h5>Arriving in Tallinn</h5>
<p>When arriving at Tallinn Airport we recommend that you obtain local currency, the Euro, as soon as you arrive. There are international ATMs inside the airport, as well as money exchange offices offering a good rate. The rate will always vary slightly depending on where you go, it may be worth changing a small amount of money at the airport for your transport and then finding a bank or money exchange within the city centre.</p>
<h5>Making your own way</h5>
<p>To make your own way to and from your hotel,&amp;nbsp;Tallinn Airport is located about four kilometres from the city centre and an estimated cost of a taxi ride to the city centre is approximately &amp;euro;10.</p>
<p>By bus: the airport&amp;rsquo;s bus stop is located in front of the terminal of arrivals. Bus No. 2 travels on the route M&amp;otilde;igu - Passenger Port. In the city centre the bus stops next to Viru Keskus at A. Laikmaa St. The bus fare is approximately &amp;euro;1.60 and tickets are sold by the bus driver. Tickets are also available from the R-Kiosk in the Passenger Terminal.</p></description></item><item><name>Accommodation on tour</name><description><p>This tour uses a variety of hotels, guesthouses and apartments. You can find a breakdown of your accommodation in the "About this Tour" section.</p>
<p>Where possible Tucan Travel try and use local accommodation on the majority of tours. The accommodation is picked based on their location to the main sites.</p>
<h5>Alternative Accommodation</h5>
<p>The type of accommodation indicated in the trip notes is a guideline. If for any reason, we need to change the accommodation listed on the itinerary, a similar standard of accommodation will be used instead. You can find the list of hotels or similar used on your itinerary under each day.</p>
<h5>Twin Share</h5>
<p>Accommodation on this trip is mostly on a twin share basis unless you have upgraded to your own room. If you wish to book a double bed, please advice your Adventure Specialist upon booking.</p>
<h5>I'd like my own room</h5>
<p>If you are a solo traveller, a private room is available on most occasions at an extra cost. This must be booked in advance.</p> 
<h5>Check-in Time</h5>
<p>Although we endeavour to have hotel rooms ready in time for arrival, sometimes this is not possible especially if we arrive early in the morning. In this instance we will store our luggage and enjoy the destination before checking in later in the day.</p></description></item><item><name>Transport</name><description><p>This tour uses a mixture of public transport and private minivans. The mode of transport is chosen based on schedule and timings, comfort, group size, location and reliability. Transport in Europe is some of the best in the world, with modern coaches and comfortable trains. The buses between Tallinn and Warsaw will be equipped with WIFI, toilets and media facilities.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to carry luggage on and off transport. Upon arrival to each city, we might be using trams, metros, subways or walking to the hotel.</p>
<h5>Approximate travel times on this trip</h5>
<p>The below information provides approximate travel times and modes of transport for your Europe tour. Please note that modes of transport may be subject to change depending on the group size and timings may vary depending on the season and border crossings on the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tallinn to Riga - 4 hours by tourist bus</li>
<li>Riga to Vilnius - 4 hours by tourist bus</li>
<li>Vilnius to Warsaw - 8 hours by tourist bus</li>
</ul>
<p>Public Transport in Europe</p>
<p>We will be making use of metros, buses and trams on this tour. When reaching the hotel or an included excursion, the ticket will be included in your tour cost however you will likely use these modes of transport in your own time too. Tickets are purchased from kiosks near/in the stations and you must validate your ticket in the yellow machines inside the transport. If you do not validate your ticket and an inspector comes on board you are likely to be fined.</p>
<p>Boat Trips and water based activities</p>
<p>This tour includes various locations where boat trips and other water based activities are either included in the tour or available to book as an optional excursion. It is your responsibility to wear life jackets and taking part in these activities is at your own risk.</p></description></item><item><name>Luggage and Packing </name><description><h5>Luggage</h5>
<p>You will be carrying your own luggage on tour. Please limit this to one piece per person plus one day bag.</p>
<p>It is important to bring luggage you can carry and lift comfortably, potentially up several flights of stairs in hotels where elevators are not available and between bus/train stations and hotels.</p>
<h5>Packing List</h5>
<p>Please consider which season you are travelling in and pack appropriately. All clothes should be lightweight, durable and easily washable. Please do not bring any military or camouflage-style clothing as it can be dangerous to wear and occasionally illegal. Nights can be cold, so it is a good idea to bring at least one pair of warm trousers or jeans plus several thinner sweaters / fleeces which you can layer.</p>
<p>Good, comfortable walking shoes are essential. There can either be comfortable trainers or walking shoes. You will find you walk a lot in Europe, sometimes on uneven and cobbled streets.</p>
<p>In general, Europe is not as conservative as other regions, and you do not have to worry about keeping your legs or shoulders covered on a day to day basis. However, when visiting religious sites, you will need to cover up. We recommend having long trousers or a sarong to cover up for this.</p>

Hotel services can be pretty costly however your tour leader will be able to recommend cheaper options. If you wash clothes yourself take care not to be too obvious where you hang them as most hotels do not like guests washing and drying their clothes in the hotel rooms.</p></description></item><item><name>Money and Budget</name><description><h5>Currency</h5>
<p>This tour uses a total of 2 different currencies. This includes the euro which is used in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. It is worth bearing in mind that many of the below countries will accept euro but they will give you change in their local currency.</p>
<p>Below are the other currencies used on this tour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polish Zloty</li>
</ul>
<h5>Local Payment</h5>
<p>The majority of our tours are divided into two separate payments. The tour price is paid directly to your travel consultant when you book and before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the Local Payment, which is paid locally when you join the tour.</p>
<p>The Local Payment ensures your Tour Leader has a supply of cash to run some of the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The Local Payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.</p>
<p>The Local Payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your Tour Leader in the currency as indicated on your tour vouchers. The Local Payment is not optional and failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour. It must be paid in high denomination notes only (100s, 50s, 20s). The notes must be crisp with no tears or markings and should be no older than 2013.</p>
<h5>Cards</h5>
<p>The majority of shops, restaurants, hotels and other establishments in Europe will accept credit and debit cards. American Express is not as widely accepted, so do not rely on this as your primary card.</p>
<h5>Spending Money</h5>
<p>We know how easy it is to lose track of your spending on holiday! That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s essential to thoroughly read your trip notes so that you understand what is and what isn&amp;rsquo;t included on each day. Lunches and dinners are at your own cost, which gives you the flexibility to spend as little or as much as you like. Remember to budget for things like laundry, tipping, souvenirs and optional activities. In general, Eastern Europe is much cheaper than Western Europe.</p>
<p>Take note of how long you will be spending in each country and don&amp;rsquo;t take out or exchange too much money. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a big spender, you won&amp;rsquo;t need thousands just for two days in a country! We recommend checking your international withdrawal and exchange fees with your bank, as sometimes it is cheaper to withdraw money in your location rather than exchanging it beforehand.</p>
<h5>Tipping</h5>
<p>Tipping is a big part of European culture, and while it is much more prominent in Western Europe it is still expected in most of the Eastern Europe countries. While it is not compulsory, if you have enjoyed the service it is appropriate and highly appreciated. You should add 10% to your bill in restaurants (make sure service isn&amp;rsquo;t already included), round up taxi fares and tip local excursion guides.</p>
<h5>Free Walking Tours</h5>
<p>Free walking tours are found in almost every destination throughout Europe, especially in the larger cities where you will find a few companies offering the same tour. These are marketed as free walking tours and are designed to provide travellers with local, in depth knowledge of the city. However all free walking tours are tip based (they have to make money somehow, after all!) and so if you wish to join a free walking tour you need to budget in a tip at the end. Depending on how much you enjoyed the tour, anything from 5EUR to 20EUR is appropriate. Leaving a free walking tour that was considered a good tour without tipping is very disrespectful and will only give travellers a bad reputation.</p>
<h5>Budget</h5>
<p>Your budget should include additional meals, transport within cities, optional excursions, shopping and an emergency fund. With so much on offer your budget in Europe can vary a lot, but we suggest a bare minimum of 25EUR per day in Eastern Europe and the Balkans and a minimum of 35EUR per day in Central Europe, Slovenia and Croatia.</p>
<h5>Backup Funds</h5>
<p>Travel can be unpredictable. While we endeavour to plan for every situation there are some instances where it is out of our control, such as severe weather, strikes, civil unrest or natural disasters. If these result in unavoidable itinerary changes, you should have access to enough funds for you to return home unexpectedly.</p></description></item><item><name>Meals and Dietary Requirements</name><description><p>On a Tucan Travel tour you will experience a huge variety of amazing food in each location. Meals included are listed on the day to day itinerary and the "about your tour" section. On this trip, most breakfasts are included but lunch and dinner are at your own cost. Your tour leader will suggest restaurants in each location, and arrange evening group meals for those who wish to join. In the majority of European cities, there is a huge choice of both local and international restaurants.</p>
<p>If you have a specific dietary requirement it is important you advise us at the booking stage. We also recommend re-iterating this information to your tour leader on day 1. While we endeavour to assist as much as possible, it is ultimately your responsibility to research and arrange meals that suit your dietary preferences.</p>
<p>Food in Europe differs between countries. In Eastern and Central Europe, the standard diet is mostly meat based. Vegetarians will have options but may find themselves more limited than back home. Vegans and those on a gluten free diet will find it more challenging and you might need to pick up your own supplies at a supermarket.</p></description></item><item><name>Health and Safety </name><description><h5>Emergency Contact</h5>

<h5>Safety in Europe</h5>
<p>Europe is generally very safe, even more so in a group. There are a few precautions which you should always take.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not travel with valuables. While phones and cameras are inevitable, leave the expensive jewellery and watches at home.</li>
<li>Make sure your handbag/daypack has a zip and is closed at all times.</li>
<li>When in crowded areas and on metros keep your bag on your front.</li>
<li>Do not walk alone after dark.</li>
<li>Only use registered taxis and if possible have the hotel phone one for you.</li>
<li>Do not take out large sums of cash at once and avoid keeping it all in the same place. Only take what you need for the day and leave the rest in a safe. Ideally, take more than one credit/debit card in case one is lost or stolen.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h5>Scams in Europe</h5>
<p>Unfortunately there are many common scams occurring regularly across Europe. While these are normally harmless to your personal safety, they can leave you losing money. The most common are people approaching you seemingly offering a gift, to then turn around and ask for money, children distracting you while someone goes through your bag, people pretending to be stranded/lost/mugged and asking you for money or people asking you to sign a fake charity petition, while someone else dips into your pocket. Pickpocket gangs often work in teams, so while one bumps into you and fumbles around apologising, another might be searching for a wallet. These scams are easily avoided by keeping your bag zipped at all times and on your front in crowds, and using your common sense when someone approaches you.</p>
<h5>Traffic and crossing the road</h5>
<p>Traffic is Europe can be hectic. You should always look both ways before crossing the road, depending on the country they might drive on the other side of the road. Rules on jaywalking can vary between countries, so we suggest always using pedestrian and zebra crossings.</p>
<h5>Travel Insurance</h5>
<p>Travel insurance is compulsory on all Tucan Travel tours. Your tour leader will request your travel insurance details at the pre departure meeting which are immediately submitted to the office. Failure to produce these details will mean you cannot join the tour.</p>
<h5>Age Restrictions</h5>
<p>Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced and sometimes tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities, some groups can be more boisterous than others. As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them. We may ask that you fill in our tour suitability form found <a href="tour-suitability-form">here</a> to guarantee your enjoyment of the trip. Please read through our <a href="about-us/before-you-go/tour-suitability">Tour Suitability page</a> or contact a member of our Reservations Team if in doubt. Please note that we do not accept children under the age of 16 on our group tours.</p></description></item><item><name>Responsible Travel</name><description><p>As a global tour operator, we understand the importance of running sustainable tours that have as low an impact on the environment as possible.
