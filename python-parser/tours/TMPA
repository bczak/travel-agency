Nestled between two primary cloud forest reserves, the high altitude of the town, some 1440 metres above sea level, results in a steady supply of clouds. The moisture from these clouds catches on the branches of the tallest trees and drips down to the other organisms below, supporting a complex and far-reaching ecosystem. Over 100 species of mammals, thousands of insect species and over 2500 varieties of plants all thrive here. Once you have checked in to your hotel, the remainder of the day is at your leisure.</p><p>The next day you will enjoy guided visit to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve where you can choose from a number of hiking trails. Enjoy views of the Continental Divide from the  “La Ventana” scenic overlook and discover for yourself the moisture-laden winds blowing in that create the clouds of the cloud forest. Try the canopy walkways that connect the huge trees where over 500 bird species live such as the magnificent quetzal and the three-wattle bellbird. There are more than 3000 species of plants, 500 of them orchids, 120 of reptiles and amphibians, and 130 of mammals.</p></description><accommodation>2 night(s) in hotels .

Once a sleepy town, the Arenal Volcano erupted violently after almost 400 years of dormancy and the town became the jumping off point for people in search of fiery night skies and creeping lava. The amazing scenery of the area, the scenic Lake Arenal, numerous nearby hot springs and adventure activities have made La Fortuna one of the most popular regions in Costa Rica.</p><p>In the afternoon you will meet your guide and do some hiking in the secondary forest around the Arenal Volcano National Park. The area contains a great wealth of geologic and biological complexity and you will hike over the lava fields at the foot of the volcano, one of the most active in the Americas. To end the day, soak away any weary muscles at the nearby hot springs. Enjoy a soothing bath in the natural pools with a refreshing waterfall shower against the backdrop of beautiful, tropical gardens and under a starry sky.</p><p>The next day is yours to spend as you please.</p></description><accommodation>2 night(s) in hotels .
