On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Poland! Warsaw, Poland's capital, has been revitalised as a tourist destination. The city was almost entirely destroyed in World War II but a lot of effort has gone into its rebuilding. Since the fall of communism many old buildings have given way to modern skyscrapers, the dilapidated old town has been brightened up, and entertainment and services transformed to match that of other western capitals.We recommend booking pre tour accommodation or arriving on an early flight so that you can fully enjoy Warsaw and all the city has to offer.There will be a pre departure meeting held in your hotel at 6pm tonight.
