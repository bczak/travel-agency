Packed with game drives, fascinating cultures and delicious cuisine, this tour takes in many of the region\u2019s best highlights. We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Nairobi and the start of your adventure! Kenya\u2019s capital city is a hub for business and culture with an inner population of around 3.5 million.You are free to arrive today at your leisure. If you wish to go exploring, we recommend seeking local advice from the hotel about where is safe to walk. Petty theft is unfortunately common in Nairobi and you should remain vigilant at all times.There will be a pre departure meeting tonight to meet your tour leader and fellow travellers. Please look out for information on reception.We depart Nairobi early, after breakfast and drive to our lunch spot where we will exchange our expedition truck for 4WD safari vehicle before continuing on to the Masai Mara Nature Reserve. On arrival we get straight into our first game drive in one of the world's most famous and expansive wildlife reserves.Covering over 1,500 square kilometres and providing habitat for thousands of animals, the Masai Mara Nature Reserve is deservedly one of Kenya\u2019s most popular safari spots. Animals present in the reserve include the big five (lions, elephants, Cape buffaloes, leopards and rhinoceros), various grazing mammals which attract carnivores such as cheetahs, hyenas and jackals, and over 500 recorded species of birds. We stay just outside the park in permanent tents, enjoying a buffet dinner in the evening.The following morning we leave camp early for a second game drive, visiting the mighty Mara River. During the annual Great Migration, this is the setting for the thunderous display of thousands of wildebeest crossing the river while canny crocodiles lie in wait. At any time of year, the river is vitally important to the ecosystem and a good spot to view animals. You will also have the opportunity to visit a local Masai village, learning about the vibrant, semi-nomadic herders\u2019 way of life and join them in a local dance.This morning we leave camp early for a second game drive, visiting the mighty Mara River.

It is here that we will prepare to enter the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater. You will stay here for the night, leaving your belongings with the truck and taking only an overnight bag on your included excursion to the Serengeti NP and Ngorongoro Crater tomorrow.A place that needs no introduction, the Serengeti National Park is the most famous safari destination in Africa. We\u2019re picked up after breakfast and taken by 4WD to the national park. The afternoon is spent game driving to our lodge, located inside the national park to maximise our time and wildlife viewing opportunities.Before we reach the Serengeti plains, we\u2019ll stop for a stunning vista overlooking the Ngorongoro Crater, the largest unbroken, unflooded caldera in the world. The vast 300 square kilometre crater stretches out in front of you in a kaleidoscope of blues and greens and it\u2019s not until you spot the barely discernible grey speck of an elephant that you truly grasp its scale.Our second day in the park is a full day of game driving, trying to spot the more elusive members of the animal kingdom before heading to our lodge just outside the Ngorongoro Crater.Every safari is unique and you will never know what\u2019s in store for you until you arrive. Among the hundreds of species in the park, you may encounter zebra, giraffe, wildebeest, buffalo, lion, cheetah, leopard, hippopotamus, hyena, elephant, vulture, monkey, warthog, gazelle and impala. Each season offers a different highlight.Our final morning game driving is spent inside the crater itself - a good place to spot black rhinoceros, elephant and lions.This afternoon, we return to stay in Arusha and reunite with the overland truck.Today we are bound for the enigmatic, intoxicating Isles of Zanzibar.
