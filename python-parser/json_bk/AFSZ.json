The vast 300 square kilometre crater stretches out in front of you in a kaleidoscope of blues and greens and it\u2019s not until you spot the barely discernible grey speck of an elephant that you truly grasp its scale.Our second day in the park is a full day of game driving, trying to spot the more elusive members of the animal kingdom before heading to our lodge just outside the Ngorongoro Crater.Every safari is unique and you will never know what\u2019s in store for you until you arrive. Among the hundreds of species in the park, you may encounter zebra, giraffe, wildebeest, buffalo, lion, cheetah, leopard, hippopotamus, hyena, elephant, vulture, monkey, warthog, gazelle and impala.
