Uncover medieval ruins in Fes before riding camels deep into the Sahara desert to stay at a Berber camp. Admire how the colours change on the walls of Todra Gorge and get lost in the maze of souks in Marrakech. We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.Welcome to Morocco! You will be transferred from the airport to your hotel where you have the remainder of the day to relax or explore.Marrakech is one of the most captivating and unique cities in North Africa, encompassed by the incredible peaks of the Atlas Mountain range. Founded around 1062 by the Almoravids, Marrakech went on to become the capital city of the Almohad caliphate during the 12th century, which covered most of Spain and Africa. It flourished for centuries until during a period of unrest in the early 20th century, the French went on to colonise Morocco. While their influence lives on in the architecture and language, the country holds strong traditions and culture, with beautiful mosques and medinas found in the cities.Take a step back in time and lose yourself in the maze of souks and spice markets in the ancient medina, wander the labyrinthine of stalls with colourful skeins of wool drying above your head against bright blue skies or pick your way through alleys lined with elaborately decorated brass lamps while dodging donkeys.Let all your troubles float away as you unwind in a traditional hammam, sample the delicious food such as hummus, couscous, tagine and zaalouk and of course relax with a Moroccan mint tea.You will have a pre departure meeting at 6pm tonight to meet your tour leader and group.This morning we travel to Casablanca where we collect the rest of the group joining this tour.
